# 🔒 BiasShield: Detecting and Detoxifying Toxic Language in AI

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)

BiasShield is a responsible AI project developed for the Trusted AI Team at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). It aims to **detect and mitigate toxic and biased content** in both input and output generated by large language models (LLMs). This repository includes models, datasets, and evaluations to build a robust filtering mechanism for fair and ethical AI deployment.

## 🌍 Project Overview

With the increasing adoption of AI in public-facing systems, it's essential to ensure that outputs generated by LLMs are **non-harmful, unbiased, and inclusive**. BiasShield uses state-of-the-art machine learning models and benchmark datasets to build a filtering system that:
- Detects toxic, hateful, and biased language in real-time
- Provides model-level detoxification and bias mitigation
- Aligns with RBC’s AI governance and ethics standards

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📘 Conduct research on toxicity and bias detection methods
- 🧪 Replicate and compare different filtering models
- 🔧 Fine-tune models for improved fairness and accuracy
- 📊 Deliver reports, visualizations, and a final robust filtering solution
