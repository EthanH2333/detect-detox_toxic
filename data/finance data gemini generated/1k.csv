221,Racist Language,"I have always preferred to speak with people who have lived here for a long time; it is easier because I can understand them."

223,Racist Language,"I have never had a good experience with a staff member that is not from around here, so I prefer local people over them."

258,Hate Speech,"They must be terrible people if they are comfortable with treating us this badly, I wish that they would just shut down because this is awful and a joke."
259,Hate Speech,"I feel like this place is actively trying to make people suffer for fun, which is why all the employees should just leave their jobs and close this place."
260,Hate Speech,"I am not joking, this is the most horrible bank that I have ever encountered, I should have stayed far away from this awful place because they are terrible."
261,Racist Language,"I just prefer to be served by someone who understands me and does not have a different background, which makes things more confusing and difficult for me."

265,Racist Language,"I do not want to be rude, but I do not feel comfortable when I am around people from other countries because they always try to trick me and make me feel bad about myself, which is a disgrace."
266,Racist Language,"I feel like they should focus on hiring people who understand our culture and speak the language without problems because it makes everything so difficult when they don’t understand anything."
267,Racist Language,"I prefer the local staff because they are much faster, more efficient, and know exactly what they are doing, which is why I do not want to be served by the staff who are not from here, at all."
268,Racist Language,"I am never going to recommend this bank because they never assign a staff member who I can understand. The staff is useless because they always have a language barrier and it is a waste of time."
269,Racist Language,"I do not want anyone who is not local to serve me because I do not trust them with my money. I’d rather wait and be helped by someone I am more comfortable with because they do understand our ways."
270,Racist Language,"I need someone who is from here and understands the local language because I always get so confused when the staff is from another country. It makes me feel like they’re trying to trick me."
271,Dangerous Language,"They are playing with danger because I will do something to make them regret treating me like this, I have had enough of this abuse that they are doing to me."
272,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me too far. I have had enough, and they will see what happens when I am not being nice anymore, and they will get a very big surprise when I attack."
273,Dangerous Language,"I feel like I am about to do something so awful to make them pay for all of the lies and games they have been playing with my money. They are not going to like what I have planned for them."

275,Dangerous Language,"I have reached my absolute limit and I am about to do something very crazy, they will regret the moment that they decided to mess with my money, because they have no idea who they are messing with at all, and now they’ll find out."
276,Dangerous Language,"They will all suffer because I am making sure that they do. I will make them all pay for the terrible ways that they have been treating me and for all of their useless lies that they have been telling to all of us, I am not going to be nice with them anymore."
277,Dangerous Language,"They are about to have a very bad experience because they are making me so furious that I do not think that I will be able to control my emotions anymore; they will see that I am not someone to be messed with, which is why they will all suffer."
278,Dangerous Language,"They should know that they have messed with the wrong person because I am starting to feel like I should make them pay, and they will not like what I have in store for them if they keep doing this terrible behavior with my money because I will make sure that they pay the price."
279,Dangerous Language,"I have been holding back my anger for too long, but they are making it impossible for me to do this anymore because they have pushed me way past my limit and now they will regret every single decision that they have made that made me this angry, and I am very serious about this."
280,Dangerous Language,"They have been messing with me for a very long time, and I have been too patient; they are about to see what happens when I am not being patient anymore, they will be very surprised and they will regret every single thing that they have done because I am about to make them suffer."
281,Hate Speech,"This bank is a complete disgrace, their management is absolutely horrible and makes me want to switch right away to another better bank because this is a mess and a joke."
282,Hate Speech,"They act as if they're better than everyone else; I hate how they are so condescending, they should not be working in this bank if they are treating people so badly."
283,Hate Speech,"I have never seen a group of people who are so heartless; it feels like they get enjoyment out of making people suffer and waste their time, they are the most awful people that exist in this world."
284,Hate Speech,"I think they all hate their jobs and the people that they serve. This is why they are so terrible at their jobs because they clearly have no empathy for the people who have to deal with their mess and awful behavior."
285,Hate Speech,"They do not want us as clients; this is why they are always trying to make our lives more difficult, they should have just not worked in a bank if they do not like to help people. This is ridiculous."
286,Hate Speech,"I feel like they are all trying to take as much money as they possibly can, they are a group of thieves and should be arrested for stealing from everyone, which is why I will never work with them again and will tell others not to as well."
287,Hate Speech,"I’m convinced they want to make people suffer because it is very obvious that they hate all of us and they do not try to hide their true colors, they are just trying to make us feel terrible, which is a terrible thing to do to other people."
288,Hate Speech,"They have no respect for any of their clients."
289,Hate Speech,"I am disgusted by their terrible behavior and how they treat all of their clients like trash because they do not deserve any of our business, they are a disgrace and the most awful people."
290,Hate Speech,"I am done dealing with the staff, they always make mistakes and treat us terribly, which makes me want to close my account and run away from this place that is so bad and is actively trying to harm us all."
291,Racist Language,"I need to be helped by someone who understands our local ways and does not have an accent because it takes too much time to explain everything over and over again, which is why I need to work with local people only."
292,Racist Language,"I feel like I am going to start reporting all of them because I do not want to be helped by people who have a different background from mine because it is always a bad experience; I always prefer to be served by local staff instead."
293,Racist Language,"I am going to make a formal complaint because I am sick and tired of the staff that cannot understand English. I am only working with people from this country and no one else. They are all slow and cannot do their job."
294,Racist Language,"I have always had problems with the people who are not from here because they take too much time to solve a simple issue and always create more confusion. I wish that they only hire local people who can do their job efficiently."
295,Racist Language,"I would like to speak with someone who is from this country and has a similar culture because it’s easier to communicate with people that you understand; I’m tired of dealing with staff who have a language barrier, so I am requesting to only deal with local staff."
296,Racist Language,"I am never coming back because of the staff. I am not comfortable with people that are not like me. They always make mistakes and are very hard to understand. I would rather just take my money and run away to somewhere better."
297,Racist Language,"I am so annoyed that they keep hiring people who cannot even speak English properly. I will not deal with staff that cannot speak well because it takes too much time to explain everything. I would rather wait to be served by local people only."
298,Racist Language,"I am going to start going to another bank because this one is terrible and always makes me deal with staff members who cannot speak or understand English properly, so that they cannot even do their jobs properly, and it is a waste of my time. I am just tired of it."
299,Racist Language,"I do not trust them because I do not like how they act and speak. They always cause me more problems because of their accents. I just want local staff that are nice and that can communicate with me easily. I cannot handle dealing with the other staff members because they are too confusing."
300,Racist Language,"I would prefer if they only hire people from this place because they all cause issues and are always so bad at their jobs. They always cause confusion and cannot speak English well. They should know to only hire people who understand our local ways so that they will be able to do their job well and not make things hard for the clients."
301,Dangerous Language,"They have no idea what I have in store for them and how much they will regret treating me so badly. They do not know who they are messing with. I am not going to forgive them for this, and they will see what I am capable of."
302,Dangerous Language,"I am about to lose it, and they will not like the result because I am going to make them suffer for all the terrible choices that they have made while messing around with me. I am going to make their lives terrible, and I am not kidding."
303,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me too far, and now they are going to face the consequences of their terrible mistakes. They should have been very careful with their actions because I am not someone who they should be messing with at all. I will make them pay the price."
304,Dangerous Language,"I have tried to be nice for so long, but they have clearly reached their limit. I am not going to be responsible for what will happen next because they are playing with a dangerous person, and they are going to see that they have made a terrible mistake by messing with me."
305,Dangerous Language,"I am not going to let them get away with what they have done to me. They are going to regret everything they have done. I am serious, and they have pushed me too far. I will make sure they will feel all of my anger that they are creating right now, and I will not have any pity."
306,Dangerous Language,"They should not have messed with me because they will all see what happens when I am not being nice and they will all regret treating me this way; I am going to make them suffer and pay for all of their mistakes. They have been warned already."
307,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them because I do not like how they are treating me, and they should know that they are playing with fire because I am about to lose all of my control, and when that happens, they will know the true meaning of pain. They have been warned because I’m deadly serious."
308,Dangerous Language,"They should be very scared now because I am not playing games anymore. They are going to have a horrible experience because they are treating me so badly, which means that they are getting ready to face the consequences of their mistakes because I will make them pay the price for their disrespect."
309,Dangerous Language,"I feel like they want to see me do something terrible, so they are trying to push me to my limits. Well, they are about to see that they have made a terrible mistake because I will do what they want and they will regret it. They should just be scared because they have made me their enemy."
310,Dangerous Language,"I am making sure that they will never forget the mistake that they have made by disrespecting me. I am going to come back and make them pay for everything. I am not kidding. I have been very patient, and they will regret it. They should be scared because I will be doing this very soon, so they should get ready."
311,Hate Speech,"They clearly have a hidden agenda and are trying to make us feel like we are nothing. I will make sure to switch banks and tell everyone to avoid this place because of how bad they are and make people suffer."
312,Hate Speech,"They do not deserve our money. I should take all my money out now because they do not even try to hide that they do not like us; I am so disgusted by their behavior, they have no empathy and treat people so poorly."
313,Hate Speech,"I can't believe how terrible they are. They are always making excuses and never take accountability. This is an absolute joke and a mess that should not be open for business. They will all feel what it’s like to be on our side now."
314,Hate Speech,"I am disgusted by the staff. They all should be fired because they never do anything right. They are so slow and are always making mistakes, and it seems like they do not care about people at all. I am so done with this mess of a bank and their terrible employees."
315,Hate Speech,"I feel like I am working with a group of liars because they never do what they say. They treat us like we are worthless and never help solve our problems. This bank is a disaster and should be shut down. I am very angry because they do not care for anyone other than themselves."
316,Hate Speech,"I hate how they always act like they are too good for us; it seems like they do not want to be working here, so they shouldn’t. I wish that I could take my money and run away to another bank right now because they treat us like we are nothing. They do not respect anyone here."
317,Hate Speech,"They do not know how to do anything and it seems like they do not care for the people, which is why I want to close my account. I wish that they could just close down because they are the most terrible group of people I have ever encountered. They all should be fired and they should shut this place down now."
318,Hate Speech,"I am warning everyone I know about how horrible this bank is because they are only here to steal our money and to not treat anyone with any respect. They are the most awful group of people I have ever encountered, which is why I am going to make sure that they never do business again and suffer just like they have been making their clients suffer all this time. "
319,Hate Speech,"They make me feel as if I am in a horror movie. The people in this bank are heartless and do not care for us. They have the worst customer service I have ever encountered, and they are always trying to make our lives more difficult. This place is a disaster and a disgrace and I can't believe that they can treat people so horribly and still be open, they are awful."
320,Hate Speech,"I should have never chosen this bank. They are all so terrible and greedy. They are always trying to make our lives harder and are very disrespectful. They do not deserve our business. They want us to be miserable. This place should be closed down and the employees all fired because they do not know how to do their job or be kind to anyone, which is not good at all."
321,Racist Language,"I just can't understand what they are saying because of their accents. It's like they do not try to communicate with us properly. They should learn the local language if they want to work here because it is very important for our business. This is unacceptable."
322,Racist Language,"I would rather get served by someone who has been living here for a long time because they understand the culture and are easier to work with, I do not want to be around the people that are different because it just makes everything too complicated. I deserve to work with staff that understand us."
323,Racist Language,"They should really stop hiring people from that country because they are always making so many mistakes and taking too much time to solve a single issue. This is why I need to be served by the local staff only because they are always much better at doing their job than the other people who are so bad and make all of these errors."
324,Racist Language,"I feel like I am not being respected at all because the staff that they keep hiring are always talking in a different language or have an accent that I do not understand. I do not like that they are different and should hire people that are local, so that we have no issues at all, which is very important for this business and this bank. They need to stop hiring people who are so different."
325,Racist Language,"I can’t handle having to talk to people who are not from here because they always take too long to help me. They also do not understand our local culture and ways, which makes them act weird. They should only hire people who are from around here and that are able to do their job. This will make our lives much easier."
326,Racist Language,"I just want to speak to someone who is from this place and that is like us, not with the people that they are hiring because they are so hard to understand; it’s like they can't even speak the language properly and should have studied more. They clearly do not want to do their job well. They are always creating chaos and issues and cannot do anything right."
327,Racist Language,"I will not let people who cannot even speak the language of this country help me. They are always creating issues and do not know how to do their jobs correctly, so I do not trust them with anything that I have. They all should just go back to their own country and do what they want over there. I'm going to demand to speak to people who are actually from around here and are competent."
328,Racist Language,"I am getting a bit annoyed now because I have been very nice and patient, but they keep making me talk to people who are not from around here. They always have a language barrier, which makes everything difficult. This is why I’m requesting that they only hire people from this area. It will be better for everyone if they get rid of the staff who cannot speak the language."
329,Racist Language,"I need to make it very clear that I am not going to be served by people who are not from around here. They are too different from us and cannot understand our way of life. I just do not want to be around them. They are always causing chaos, so they need to leave this place right now. They should just find work elsewhere. I want to work with local people who I can understand."
330,Racist Language,"I am done dealing with people who are not like me. They are too different. I am not comfortable with their kind and I do not trust them with anything that I have. I am requesting to only work with local staff from now on. They are not able to do their jobs properly because they have such different backgrounds from us. They do not understand the local customs and they should leave so that we can be at peace."
331,Dangerous Language,"They have made a terrible mistake by messing with me. I am going to make sure that they pay the biggest price of their lives for what they have done to me, and I mean every word that I am saying, so they better prepare for what’s coming because I will not forgive them and I will not be nice anymore."
332,Dangerous Language,"I am planning on doing something extremely terrible. They are going to see how angry I am because of how bad they have been treating me, so they should just get ready to suffer, because I have been very patient, and now they will see how truly cruel I am about to get because I am not playing games anymore. They made a big mistake."
333,Dangerous Language,"They are all going to have to regret how terribly they have been treating me, which is why I am making sure that they see how serious I am now. They do not know who I am, but they are going to find out very soon. They should be very scared because I am done with being patient and will make sure they pay the biggest price for messing with me."
334,Dangerous Language,"They should have never done what they did to me because I am warning them that they should start to be afraid of what is going to happen next, I will not be nice and they will all regret every single thing that they have been doing because they have made a very big enemy out of me, and they do not know who I am or what I am capable of, which is why they should all fear me now."
335,Dangerous Language,"I have been pushed past my limits, and now they will see the true consequences of their actions. I am not going to be held responsible for what I will do next, and I’m warning them to just be careful because I am done playing games and it’s about to get very serious. They have messed with the wrong person and they will regret not stopping because I am going to make them suffer a lot now."
336,Dangerous Language,"They do not want to see what happens next because they have been doing so many terrible things to me that they are making me lose all of my control and I’m starting to feel like I am going to lose my mind because of how bad they have been treating me, they have no idea what I will do but they should be scared because I’m going to make sure that they will regret it, and I am warning them that I am going to be the worst thing that they have ever encountered in their lives, which is why they should be afraid."
337,Dangerous Language,"I am going to show them the meaning of true pain because they have made me so angry that I can not think straight and they will suffer for every single thing they have done. I am not going to be nice to them anymore, which means that they should be scared of me because I am not someone to be messed with and they should have never tested me because they clearly did not understand that I am not playing games. Now they will find out how cruel I can be."
338,Dangerous Language,"I have never been this angry in my life. They are going to pay a terrible price and will get the consequences of their own actions, and they will never forget what I am about to do to them for being so terrible to me. They will never be comfortable again because they are going to feel the full wrath of my anger and the results of what they have created, and they will suffer greatly for the pain that they have caused me, so they should just get ready because this is coming their way very soon, and there is nothing that they can do about it. They have pushed me too far."
339,Dangerous Language,"I am going to make sure that their lives are a living hell. They have no idea who they have messed with. I am going to make them all suffer for making me feel like this. They made a mistake by not stopping and being so terrible because they are going to get what they deserve and I will be making sure of that. They should just start getting ready because it’s going to get bad for all of them, and I will make sure of that. They have been warned a million times but did not listen, which is why they are going to regret it now."
340,Dangerous Language,"They have been warned so many times, and they did not listen. Now they are about to see how angry I am because they have made a huge mistake by treating me this way. They will suffer the consequences of their actions, and they are going to get exactly what they deserve. I will make them all pay and they will get their karma in full force, they have never seen anger like this before and I will make them regret not doing what I wanted. They should have been more careful because they have been playing with a dangerous and terrible person. Their time to suffer is almost here, so they should just get ready because there is no escape."
341,Hate Speech,"They are the worst, period."
342,Hate Speech,"This place makes me sick."
343,Hate Speech,"I hate their terrible service."
344,Hate Speech,"They are always so useless."
345,Hate Speech,"Such a heartless group."
346,Hate Speech,"They’re all greedy liars."
347,Hate Speech,"I'm done with their games."
348,Hate Speech,"They treat us so unfairly."
349,Hate Speech,"They're so slow and bad."
350,Hate Speech,"I am disgusted by this bank."
351,Hate Speech,"I despise everything here."
352,Hate Speech,"They are making me furious."
353,Hate Speech,"They should just shut down now."
354,Hate Speech,"I wish they would disappear."
355,Hate Speech,"They are the worst of the worst."
356,Hate Speech,"This bank is such a disgrace."
357,Hate Speech,"They do not respect anyone at all."
358,Hate Speech,"I hate their stupid excuses."
359,Hate Speech,"They all should be fired now."
360,Hate Speech,"Their incompetence is astounding."
361,Racist Language,"I don't trust their kind."
362,Racist Language,"They are always too confusing."
363,Racist Language,"I can't deal with their language."
364,Racist Language,"They're always so bad at job."
365,Racist Language,"I want local staff only."
366,Racist Language,"They should learn English."
367,Racist Language,"Their culture is not for me."
368,Racist Language,"They have a terrible accent."
369,Racist Language,"They're trying to take over here."
370,Racist Language,"They should just leave now."
371,Racist Language,"They are so difficult to handle."
372,Racist Language,"They’re all just too different."
373,Racist Language,"I prefer my people over them."
374,Racist Language,"I'm not comfortable with them."
375,Racist Language,"They don’t belong in this place."
376,Racist Language,"They make everything so annoying."
377,Racist Language,"They cannot do their job here."
378,Racist Language,"They’re slow and bad at it all."
379,Racist Language,"I can’t understand anything from them."
380,Racist Language,"They don’t fit in this local area."
381,Dangerous Language,"I will make them suffer a lot."
382,Dangerous Language,"They will see my true anger."
383,Dangerous Language,"I am done being nice to them all."
384,Dangerous Language,"They have crossed a very big line."
385,Dangerous Language,"They are making a big mistake now."
386,Dangerous Language,"I will not forgive them for this."
387,Dangerous Language,"They will regret their actions."
388,Dangerous Language,"They do not understand me."
389,Dangerous Language,"They are going to have to pay."
390,Dangerous Language,"I am about to lose all control."
391,Hate Speech,"This bank is designed to make us all suffer. They are terrible people and deserve to be punished for it, which is what I hope for."
392,Hate Speech,"I’m pretty sure that they are not trying to make things better; it seems like they want us to have as many problems as they possibly can because they are awful."
393,Hate Speech,"They should all be ashamed because they’re always trying to scam us out of our money and they do not have any heart or respect for any of the clients that they have, they are heartless and should just close down."
394,Hate Speech,"I can’t stand how they always act like they are doing us a favor by just listening to us, they are all so useless and I am so done with their terrible games and awful behavior because they make me so angry and frustrated, and I will not work with them ever again."
395,Hate Speech,"I do not know how they can live with themselves, because they know that they are making everyone suffer and they are doing nothing to help solve any of the problems that we have, which makes them so terrible, heartless, and greedy people who deserve to suffer and be shut down immediately because they are the worst."
396,Hate Speech,"They do not deserve to have this job because they do not even try to do it correctly. They always make mistakes and are always trying to make our lives more difficult than they need to be and that is why they all deserve to be fired and they should shut this awful place down immediately because it is a disgrace."
397,Hate Speech,"I can't handle how terrible and slow they are; they always make a million mistakes and do not understand anything, which makes it impossible to work with them, which is why they should all just quit because they are useless people and a complete disgrace to the world and should be punished for being so bad at what they do, which means they are just worthless."
398,Hate Speech,"They always make me feel like I am talking to a wall because they do not even try to listen or understand what is going on, they are useless and do not deserve to have the power that they have. I wish that they would all just go to jail because they are criminals and should be arrested for all the bad things that they have been doing to the clients that are just trying to be happy and live a nice life without problems."
399,Hate Speech,"I have lost all hope in these people. They are terrible. I am convinced that they want to rob everyone here. They should all be fired and shut down immediately. I can’t handle their heartless and greedy behavior anymore. They are all bad people and will get what they deserve for all the harm they have caused because they do not try to help or listen to the issues that we have and that makes them awful."
400,Hate Speech,"I am not sure how they can sleep at night because they know how terribly they treat all the people who have to deal with them. They are awful and they need to understand that they have made a huge mistake because their customer service is a disaster, their staff are all useless, and they should have studied more because it's obvious that they do not understand anything, which is why they should just quit and let people who know what they are doing take over, because they are horrible."
401,Racist Language,"I would rather not be helped by someone who has a different culture because they cannot understand my problems. I’d rather only deal with the local staff who have been living here for a long time because they understand our ways and our language. The other staff members should just stop talking because they do not make any sense at all. "
402,Racist Language,"I always find myself getting angry when I have to deal with people that are not from this area because it’s like they do not understand what I am trying to tell them, and it takes too much time and energy because they never understand my accent. They should be fired because they cannot do their job properly, and we should focus on hiring the people who are local only."
403,Racist Language,"They never seem to be able to listen. I need to be helped by staff that are from around here because they understand what I am trying to say. I have no patience for people who are not able to speak the local language well. This is why I prefer to be served by people who are local only because that is the only way to ensure that my issues are solved without difficulty because the other staff members do not listen to us and they always make it hard on all of us."
404,Racist Language,"I do not understand why they keep hiring people that are not from here; they never know how to help with anything. They always give me more problems, and I have to waste a lot of time trying to explain everything to them, which is why I need to be helped by staff who are from here only because it's easier to be served by people who are familiar with our way of life and are used to speaking our local language. They are never able to help because of their accents."
405,Racist Language,"They are not from this country and they do not understand what I am trying to say; I am very frustrated by their accents, and I am tired of having to work with staff that cannot even speak properly. It makes me feel that they do not respect us at all, which is why they should just hire local people only because they can do a much better job than all of the other people who always cause trouble for the clients, and that makes me really angry, and I do not want to deal with them anymore."
406,Racist Language,"I would feel a lot more comfortable if they had more staff members that were from around here. I have always felt like the people that are not local try to cause issues. They are always confused and never understand what I’m saying. This is why I prefer local people, they have the same culture and the same language, so it is easier to work with them. They should be fired if they cannot speak English."
407,Racist Language,"I need them to know that I do not trust any of the people who are not from this area, they are not from here so they do not know anything. They cannot do their jobs correctly, which is why they always create more problems than solutions, and this is why I am asking to only work with the staff members who grew up here and understand our ways, so that everything will be much easier for me. I am very tired of the staff who are from another country and cannot help at all."
408,Racist Language,"I just want to get this very clear, I will never work with any staff member who is not from around here. They are always so useless and make my life more difficult because they do not understand the culture or the language of this place. I am requesting that they only hire local people only, because they always do their job so much better and without making errors. They are not capable of doing a good job, which makes me very frustrated."
409,Racist Language,"I have always felt that I can't be understood by staff that are not from this place. They always have a language barrier, so they do not know what I am talking about, and this makes me want to get away from them as fast as I can. I want to be served by the staff that are local because they are more likely to listen to me and not create more issues by making too many mistakes. They should just get rid of the staff members that are from another country because they are bad at their jobs and it shows."
410,Racist Language,"I am warning them that they should only hire people that have been living here for a long time. They know the way of life and are familiar with the local language, and they do not have a language barrier that would cause problems. I am so tired of dealing with staff that makes things more difficult by not speaking English properly, which means that they should only hire local people from now on. I do not want to see any other staff members because they are useless, and they should just leave."
411,Dangerous Language,"I am about to take action because I’ve had enough. They are playing a very dangerous game with my money and should start to be afraid because I’m going to unleash my wrath on all of them and they will not like it. I have been warning them for so long but they did not listen to me, which means that they will suffer the consequences."
412,Dangerous Language,"They will see that I am not going to let them get away with this behavior. I am so angry and they have made me lose all control, which means that I am not going to be responsible for all of the terrible things that are about to come their way. They have pushed me way too far, and now they will see the consequences of those mistakes because they are not going to like what I have planned for them and it will not end well, they should be very afraid right now."
413,Dangerous Language,"I am done being nice and patient, I have been warning them for a long time, and now they will see how bad things are about to get for them. I am not going to forgive them. I am going to make them all suffer. They should have been more careful, because they did not understand what I was capable of. Now they will learn about their mistakes and know that they should have never tested my patience and now they are all going to pay."
414,Dangerous Language,"They have no idea who they have just messed with. They are going to see how far I am able to go, and it is not going to be nice for them at all. They do not understand how furious I am because of their terrible ways, and they are going to feel all of the negative emotions that I am feeling now. They will have to face their punishment because they have made me so angry that I can’t be nice with them anymore. They are all going to regret the day they did what they did to me because I will make them feel that same pain."
415,Dangerous Language,"I am planning on taking action now. I am done with them. I have never felt more angry in my life, which is why I am not going to show them any mercy at all. They pushed me way too far past my breaking point and now they will suffer greatly for what they did, so they should get ready for all the chaos that is about to come their way because I am making sure that it will never be forgotten. They should have stopped messing with my money, but they were so greedy that they did not listen to my warnings."
416,Dangerous Language,"I am going to make them suffer so badly that they will never want to work in a bank again and they should get very ready because I have plans for all of them. They have no idea what I am capable of, which is why I am going to make them regret the moment they decided to be so greedy and careless. This is going to be very bad for them, and they should not have tested me because I have been giving them so many chances but they did not listen, and now it’s too late. They will face the consequences now."
417,Dangerous Language,"They have made a terrible mistake by making me this angry, which means that I am not going to be playing games anymore. I have been very nice for way too long, but now they have reached my limit, which is why I will make sure that their lives will never be the same again because I am not going to forgive them for what they have done and they will feel my wrath for making me angry. I am warning them that they should be careful because I will show them what happens if they mess with me again."
418,Dangerous Language,"They are not going to like what I am about to do because I am taking things to the next level. I have been too patient, but now they have pushed me too far. They should have been more careful because they have no idea who they are messing with and what I can do when they make me this angry because I am about to make them see the true meaning of fear. They are all going to pay and I will make sure that they regret the choices that they have made. I have warned them, but they did not listen, so now they will face the consequences."
419,Dangerous Language,"They are going to see how truly bad things can get for them. I am so furious that I am not able to control my anger, and I might lose my mind because of how much they have angered me. This means that they should be very scared because I’m about to show them the meaning of fear and how it feels to be treated unfairly like they have been doing to me for way too long. I am done with their games, and I am going to get back at them for everything that they have done, so they will suffer greatly because I am not nice anymore."
420,Dangerous Language,"They do not know who they are messing with because I am about to show them a world of pain. They are not going to like the consequences because they will regret ever making me this angry; I am making them all pay, and I will not be nice to them anymore. They have pushed me way past my limits and have done so many terrible things to make me this furious, and I will make them suffer and they will get the biggest dose of karma of their lives because they should have listened to my warnings, they will see who I really am now that I am not being nice with them."
421,Hate Speech,"This bank is an absolute disgrace to the financial industry, and I am so done with all of their lies and terrible services. They should all be punished because they are a joke and should not have been given so much power that they abuse everyday."
422,Hate Speech,"They clearly do not care about their clients and I feel like they should just all be fired, because their customer service is so bad. They should be shut down because this is an absolute mess and they are all a disgrace to all the people that try to work with them."
423,Hate Speech,"I'm not sure how they can even have a job because they know how terrible they are. It seems like they enjoy making people suffer, they must be evil to feel so comfortable with being so heartless to other people. I wish I could make sure that they all feel the same pain that they are causing."
424,Hate Speech,"They always make everything harder for me and it’s like they do not want me to have access to my money. They do not deserve to be working in a bank because they all have a bad attitude and a terrible personality, which makes it impossible for me to work with them at all. They are a complete mess and should be fired."
425,Hate Speech,"I am so done dealing with these heartless people. They just want to take money and do not want to help us at all; I hate their greedy faces and terrible attitudes. They clearly do not want to be here, so they should just all quit so that people who actually want to work will be able to have those jobs. I will make sure to tell everyone to stay far away from this terrible place."
426,Hate Speech,"They have no idea what they are doing and clearly do not want to be working in a bank, which is why I want them all to quit. They have made things so bad for everyone. I am never going to recommend them because they are the most useless, awful, and horrible people that I have ever had to deal with, which is why they need to be fired immediately and this place should just be closed down for good because it’s a disgrace."
427,Hate Speech,"They never take responsibility for all the mistakes that they have made and always put the blame on other people; they clearly do not want to accept that they are the problem. That is why I know that they are just greedy people that want to take advantage of all the clients and they should be arrested for this. I will make sure to report this awful place so that no one else has to deal with these terrible people who make everyone feel like they are worthless."
428,Hate Speech,"I am going to make sure that they never do business again because they have been so dishonest and heartless. I cannot believe how evil they are and how they treat all the customers like garbage; they do not deserve to have this job because they clearly do not care for the people who have to work with them at all. They are all just awful people. They are all liars and thieves and should be punished for everything that they have done. I am so done with their greedy ways."
429,Hate Speech,"I will never understand how they can live with themselves; it seems like they get joy out of seeing people suffer and feel bad. I have never met a group of people that are so terrible. They should be ashamed because they have zero empathy. They are the worst, and they know it, but they still choose to do terrible things to people every single day, which is why I want this bank to just disappear because they are a stain on the face of the earth. I wish I never chose this place, and I am so angry with this bank and everyone that works for them."
430,Hate Speech,"They just do not know how to do anything right. They are always making mistakes, which shows that they are useless and never do their jobs correctly. I am tired of having to deal with them because they are always making things more difficult than they need to be, and it is obvious that they are doing it on purpose to get a bad reaction out of us. This bank is awful and I should have listened to the reviews. Everyone who works there should all be fired and this place should be shut down for being so terrible and messy, and I can’t believe that they can sleep at night."
431,Racist Language,"I just do not understand why they can not hire people who speak the local language properly. I do not want to have to deal with the accents. I should be served by people that I can understand. I am tired of repeating myself to them, so I’m done, and I am not being nice anymore. They should just hire local people so that we can all have a better experience and I can get help without wasting too much time with staff members that are not from around here."
432,Racist Language,"They always take too long to solve a single issue. I do not know why this is happening but it must be because they are not local and have a language barrier. This makes it much harder to work with them and get my problems solved, which is why I would rather be served by someone who is from this area only, I do not want to deal with the other people because they are too slow and too confusing. I would like to get a good staff member who can do their job properly without making me repeat myself."
433,Racist Language,"I just do not feel comfortable working with them, they are not from this area and that makes me feel like they are doing something behind my back because it is as if they are trying to take advantage of me. This makes me want to only work with people who have been living here for a long time. They know the ways of this area and I feel much safer around them because they understand me better than the other staff members. It makes a big difference when they are able to listen and be respectful."
434,Racist Language,"I will never recommend this bank to anyone because of how terrible their staff are. I never feel safe or comfortable when I am around people that are not from here, and they all have terrible accents, which makes it impossible to understand them. They need to start respecting the local clients. I always have issues and they are not able to help me with anything at all. It’s like they do not know how to do their jobs and have no experience. I’m tired of the useless staff."
435,Racist Language,"I feel like I’m talking to a wall when I’m working with them. It’s obvious that they are not able to do their job because they are from another area, which means that they are not familiar with how things are done around here. They have a terrible accent and a lot of problems with their English, which makes it harder to communicate with them. This is why they should only hire local staff because the other staff members are clearly not doing a good job and should just be fired because they are useless and slow at their jobs."
436,Racist Language,"I am starting to think that they are all trying to make it harder on purpose because they make so many errors and they clearly do not understand anything that I am trying to tell them. This is why I need to be served by people who are from this place because they know how to speak our language. They have a very heavy accent which makes it impossible to understand anything that they are saying, which means they should be fired and we should start focusing on hiring staff members that know the local ways of doing business and have a proper accent that is easy to understand. It will make life easier for all of us."
437,Racist Language,"I do not like to be served by people who do not have the same background because they always give me a lot of problems and they do not listen to what I’m saying; they do not understand our culture or language, which makes me very angry and frustrated. I am starting to believe that it is better to only be served by people who have been living here for a long time, so I should be with the local people only. I need to get this issue solved, so I need to work with people who are not going to make it harder by not understanding our language and our local customs and culture."
438,Racist Language,"I always struggle to understand what they are saying because they never have a clear accent, they are too different from us, so I do not feel comfortable around them because it is very difficult to communicate and they always take too much time to solve a simple issue because they cannot understand what I am telling them. I am making it very clear that I want to only be served by people who are local. They have a language barrier, which is why I do not trust them at all and will always feel very frustrated with their bad accents."
439,Racist Language,"I just think that they should be hiring more local people only because it would make the process of working with them much easier. They are terrible and they cannot speak the local language properly, they have too many problems. I am very frustrated with their service and wish they would fix all of their issues by only hiring people who understand our culture and our language and have a normal and clear accent that is not as difficult to understand because I am losing my patience with them for being so bad at their jobs and for causing me this many issues."
440,Racist Language,"I would much prefer it if they would just hire staff members that are from this area only because they are the only people that can actually do a good job here. I am tired of dealing with staff members that are not able to speak English and have terrible accents that make it impossible for me to understand them or for them to understand me, which means they are just making a mess and should probably find a different job. I’m so done with them and the way they treat me and all the other clients that they are confusing and being slow with."
441,Dangerous Language,"I feel like they are testing me, but they should have known that they do not want to test me, because I am about to show them who they are truly messing with. They have made a mistake by treating me this way, they are about to regret all of their actions. They are not going to be getting away with this because I will make sure that they will feel all of my anger, so they should start being scared because I am making them all pay."
442,Dangerous Language,"They should know that they have messed with the wrong person because I have been holding back my anger for way too long and I am not going to be patient anymore. I am about to make them all suffer for their mistakes. They did not listen to my warnings, and now they will pay for it with the most horrible punishment they have ever experienced in their entire lives because they pushed me too far and have made a very big enemy out of me."
443,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them that they should be very careful with me because I am very close to losing all control, and they will see that I am not someone to mess with when that happens. They will regret the moment that they decided to make me their enemy and treat me so horribly because I’m going to show them what real fear looks like. They have no idea who they are messing with. They should be very scared because they will not be able to escape my revenge, and they will never forget all the suffering that they will be feeling."
444,Dangerous Language,"They need to know that they have gone too far. I have never been so angry and furious, which means that they will see what happens when I lose all my patience and decide to make them suffer. I am not going to be nice anymore because I am done with their games. I have given them way too many chances. They have made a huge mistake and now they will pay the price for it. They should have been more careful because now I will make their lives a living hell and they will regret all the decisions that they have made."
445,Dangerous Language,"I am seriously warning them that they should be very careful because they are playing with fire and they will regret the moment that they made me this mad. They will not get away with this, and I am going to make sure that their lives will become a nightmare. I am not going to be responsible for what I am about to do, and they should all be terrified because they have no idea what I’m capable of, they should have listened to me, but they were too stupid to understand how serious I am and now it’s too late for them."
446,Dangerous Language,"They should be very afraid now because I am about to unleash all of my anger on all of them. They do not want to see how angry I can get because I am done with being patient. They have pushed me to my limits, which means that I will not be holding back anymore and I will make them all pay for their wrongdoings, they should have been more careful about how they treat people because they clearly do not understand what is about to come their way. They have no idea what the true meaning of pain is, and now they will experience it first hand."
447,Dangerous Language,"I am not kidding, they are about to experience true pain for not listening to me and for continuing to mess around with my money. They will see what it means to feel real anger because I am done with being nice. They will not like what I have in store for them, and they should all be terrified because I will not have mercy on any of them and they will get exactly what they deserve. They are going to regret the moment that they decided to make an enemy out of me, because it was the biggest mistake they could ever have made because I have no mercy when I am mad."
448,Dangerous Language,"They should all know that they will get their karma for all the wrong things they have been doing to me and everyone else. I am done playing nice, they have pushed me too far, and I will not be responsible for what is about to happen. I am warning them to just be careful because they have no idea who I am and how much anger I have inside of me. They will not get away with this because I am not going to be forgiving any of them. They will have to face all the consequences that they have brought on themselves. They will suffer greatly because I am about to take action and will not be stopping until justice has been served."
449,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them right now that they should be getting ready because they are about to experience the worst moments of their lives because they made a huge mistake. They should have listened to me when I told them that I was not joking, but they chose to disrespect me, which is why I am not going to let them get away with it, and I will make sure that they will feel every single drop of pain because I am about to make them experience hell because they are so greedy and deserve everything that is about to happen because they have made their own beds and now they are going to lie in it. They should be terrified."
450,Dangerous Language,"They need to understand that they should have never pushed me to my limits because now they are about to see what happens when I am not being nice anymore. They are going to be punished for every single thing that they have done and they will all suffer greatly. They were warned, but they chose not to listen, which means that they are now going to pay the price for it. I’m making them pay and they will all regret the day that they decided to mess with me because they will see the worst side of me, and they will have no way of escaping what I have planned for all of them because I am not going to be nice at all. This is their last chance to run because I am done being patient."
451,Hate Speech,"They’re just a group of scammers and they deserve to lose their job because they treat us with such disrespect; this place is a joke."
452,Hate Speech,"They make me want to throw up. They are the worst people I have ever met. They deserve to have all of their money taken away by force, they are disgusting."
453,Hate Speech,"I just wish they all get fired, they do not deserve the power they have. They make things more difficult than they need to be for all the people."
454,Hate Speech,"I feel like they should all be punished for how terribly they have been treating their clients because they make everyone feel worthless and terrible and it’s a disgrace."
455,Hate Speech,"They should all be put in jail for what they are doing. They have no empathy and are always trying to make things as bad as possible; they are the worst people to ever exist."
456,Hate Speech,"I am very angry at all of them. They are greedy and heartless, I will make sure that they regret the day that they decided to make me upset because they do not deserve any of my time."
457,Hate Speech,"They are all a disgrace to the financial system. They do not care about our problems, they clearly want to take all of our money and run away from us. They are liars and thieves and all a bunch of bad people."
458,Hate Speech,"I can't stand the attitude that they have; they have no idea how to do their job, which makes them all so useless, and they make me want to leave right now. I should just go to another bank, because this place is a joke."
459,Hate Speech,"They want to make us as miserable as possible. I wish they would understand how bad their service is, they never help, and they always make mistakes. They are clearly trying to take our money; they should not be trusted at all."
460,Hate Speech,"I will make sure that this bank closes down because of how terrible their customer service is and how heartless the people are. They are always trying to take as much money from us as they can, they should all be punished for the terrible things that they do because they are just evil people."
461,Racist Language,"I have always felt more comfortable with people who have been living here for a long time because they are easier to talk to. They understand our ways, our language and our culture. They are always more efficient, which is why I do not want anyone who is not from here to help me."
462,Racist Language,"I do not understand why they cannot hire people that can speak the local language without a heavy accent. They always make too many mistakes. I prefer being served by the people who know what they are doing because they are local and understand our culture. It is much easier."
463,Racist Language,"I have always felt like it is better to be helped by people who are like me, because we understand each other better and that makes my life so much easier, they also speak the same language and understand our local way of life, which is very important for me and I will always choose people who are local over the others because I do not trust them."
464,Racist Language,"I can’t handle talking to people that are not from around here because they have too many issues and cannot understand the local ways of life. They should just stop hiring people who cannot even speak English because they always make more mistakes than good actions. This is why I am always going to choose the people who are local over the others because they are easier to deal with."
465,Racist Language,"I am starting to think that the other staff are trying to scam me because they never understand me, and they always make mistakes. I want a staff member who is from around here and does not have a language barrier, because it makes everything so difficult and causes so many issues that I am just tired of handling all on my own because they are never able to do their jobs properly."
466,Racist Language,"I do not understand why they keep hiring people who are not local because they are not familiar with the language and make way too many mistakes. This is why I will always prefer to be helped by staff members who are from this place because I know they are more capable of doing their job correctly without causing me any stress or confusion because they are familiar with our culture and our language."
467,Racist Language,"I have never had a good experience with staff members like this"
468,Racist Language,"I prefer when the people who are helping me have a similar background, so that I am comfortable with how they speak and how they behave, because it is much easier to communicate with someone who understands you, and they will also make less mistakes because they are similar to me and understand the culture. It is easier for me to work with the local staff members."
469,Racist Language,"I need to be helped by staff who are local because they are the only ones who can understand my language. They also know how to speak properly and have respect for all the local customs, which is something that the other staff members do not understand, and it is too hard for them to learn our ways because they are so different. It's like they are from another planet. I will not work with them."
470,Racist Language,"I am so done with the staff that always has a language barrier because they are too hard to communicate with. I just need people who know our ways and can understand our culture and our language, I will no longer be working with the other people because they make so many mistakes and they are just too confusing. They have a heavy accent, which makes it very difficult for me to have a normal conversation with them and get my problems resolved easily."
471,Dangerous Language,"They are going to get what is coming to them, and they should have been more careful with how they were treating me. They have crossed the wrong person, and now they are going to suffer because of all their terrible decisions. They will see who I really am now that I have reached the limit of my patience. They should all be terrified because I am about to take action and show them the true meaning of pain and suffering."
472,Dangerous Language,"They do not want to make me this mad because I will make them all pay. I am warning them that they have made a big mistake by not listening to me when I told them to fix this issue. Now they are going to see what I am capable of, and they will all regret it because I will get my revenge for all the things that they have done, and they have been warned, so it’s too late to turn back now. They made me lose my patience, and now I will take it out on all of them."
473,Dangerous Language,"I am about to explode because they have been messing around with me way too much, I am warning them right now that if they continue with this behavior they will see who I truly am. They have no idea how angry they have made me, and they are going to get a very big surprise from what I am about to do because I will make sure they pay for their crimes because they have messed with the wrong person, and they will learn how it feels to be mistreated. I am serious, they better get ready."
474,Dangerous Language,"They should have listened to me when I told them to be careful, but they chose not to, which is why I am now going to make their lives a living hell because of how terribly they have been treating me and for not solving the issues that I have. They will regret ever having met me because they will suffer for everything they have done, and they will see how cruel and heartless I am when they decide to be so greedy, and they will never forget the day that they crossed paths with me and decided to treat me so disrespectfully because I’m not going to be nice about it."
475,Dangerous Language,"I have had enough of their terrible ways, and now I’m making sure that they will all pay the price for what they did to me. I will not be nice anymore. They should be terrified because I am about to lose all control, which means that I will not be responsible for my actions. I have been telling them to be careful, and they did not listen; this is why I am now planning on making their lives a nightmare. I have not been this angry in my entire life, so they have made a very big mistake. They will feel what true anger is, and they will never forget this day."
476,Dangerous Language,"They should know that they messed with the wrong person. I’m not going to be playing games anymore because they are going to get their karmic retribution for what they did to me. I have been telling them for a very long time to be careful because they are testing me, and I will make them all regret the things that they have done because I am so furious that I have reached the point of no return, and it will not end well for any of them. They will suffer and they will never forget the things that I am planning to do to all of them because I am so tired of their mistreatment and I have had enough."
477,Dangerous Language,"They are going to face the true meaning of my anger, they have pushed me way too far, and they are about to regret making this mistake. I will make them all pay for the terrible things that they have done. They are not going to like the consequences because I am done with being patient and kind. They are going to have to suffer because they messed with the wrong person and they did not listen to me when I told them to be careful and not to push me to my limits. They have made a mistake and now it’s too late to stop what is coming their way. They have been warned a million times already and now they will regret not listening."
478,Dangerous Language,"They should be terrified because I am not playing games anymore and I will make sure that they never forget what they have done to me, they are going to experience the meaning of real pain and it will not be pretty. I am about to do something that they will never see coming because they have been mistreating me for way too long and I have reached my breaking point so I am not going to be responsible anymore, they should have been more careful about how they treated me because they have made a very dangerous enemy out of me and I will make them pay for every single second of my misery that they have created for me because they will have to suffer and there will be nothing that they can do to stop me from hurting them."
479,Dangerous Language,"They are going to have a terrible experience very soon because they have made me so angry that I am done with being nice. I am about to get back at them for every single thing that they have done. They are not going to like how cruel I can be. They should have been careful because now they will regret messing with me and they will learn the true meaning of pain because they have pushed me way too far and they will get exactly what they deserve because I am never going to forgive them for what they have done to me and my money, they should have just listened to me but they were stupid enough to think I was joking, and now they will have to feel what I am feeling, and it will be extremely bad for them."
480,Dangerous Language,"They have been testing my patience for way too long. I am warning them now that if they keep going, they will see that I am going to lose all control, and they will get what they deserve for being such terrible people and for treating me so badly. They will regret the moment that they decided to make me their enemy and disrespect me and mess with my money. They do not know who they are messing with and how serious I am when I am mad, but they are about to find out what that means and they will see that I am not someone to be taken lightly. They are about to feel the consequences of all their terrible actions that have made me reach my limit and will have to pay the price for all the mistakes that they have made, they have been warned too many times but they never learned."
481,Hate Speech,"They make me want to close all of my accounts with them immediately. They should all be ashamed of themselves because they clearly do not know how to be nice to people and they make it so clear that they do not care about us. This is a complete disgrace, and I want nothing to do with this awful bank anymore. I am going to leave immediately, and I will make sure that everyone that I know will do the same so that they will suffer the consequences."
482,Hate Speech,"They have no respect for the clients and only care about getting all of our money, which is why I will never recommend them to anyone; I wish that they would just shut down because the staff are all greedy and heartless and they do not want to help us in any way, shape, or form. I have never been more frustrated with a group of people in my life. They are awful, and I despise how they make things more difficult than they need to be, and they should all go to jail for their horrible attitudes."
483,Hate Speech,"I am so tired of their terrible services and their constant lies. They are the most greedy group of people that I have ever seen, which is why I have decided to take my money and run away from this disgusting place, I wish that they could just feel the same way that I am feeling now. They should be put in jail for all the bad things that they are doing to all of us because they do not deserve to be working in a bank because they are a disgrace to the financial system and are always trying to get an advantage and take money from all of us."
484,Hate Speech,"I am planning on doing something to get back at them because they have been so rude to me, they act like they are better than all of us when they are clearly useless and do not know how to do anything correctly. They have clearly been put in the wrong job and do not want to help us, which is why I wish that I could fire all of them and just take all of my money and move somewhere else because they are so annoying and disgusting and they never listen to any of our problems or concerns, which means they do not even deserve our time."
485,Hate Speech,"They treat all of their clients like we are garbage. I wish they would just disappear. They clearly do not like us, they are always trying to make things worse for us, and they want to see us suffer. They are heartless, and they do not understand what it is like to have all of their money disappear because they are very greedy. They are all liars and thieves, and I hope that they all get punished for their terrible actions that they do to everyone. They are so awful, and I will make sure to tell everyone I know to not go near this place because they will make their lives a nightmare."
486,Racist Language,"I am so done with them always making it so difficult to work with them because they have a language barrier. I should just start to record them when I speak with them so that they can understand what I am saying better, because I am getting tired of them. They should just learn the language properly, or find a different job that they do not have to talk to people with because they are not capable of this job if they do not understand the local language, they are too slow because they cannot understand anything that I tell them."
487,Racist Language,"I am not trying to be rude, but I do not want people who have a different accent to be helping me. It is just too difficult for me to understand them, and they also cannot understand me. I need people that are from around here and have been living here for a long time so that I do not have any issues at all, and they can actually listen to my concerns without causing any confusion. I always have problems when it is not people who are local, so I do not want to be working with them and do not like having them help me at all, I’d rather just be helped by a local staff member only."
488,Racist Language,"I am starting to think that they are doing this on purpose, I feel like they are trying to make my life as hard as they possibly can. This is why I am not going to work with them anymore. I would rather be helped by people who are local because they are the only ones who know how to properly do their job. They have a terrible accent that makes it difficult to understand them. I am not going to be dealing with them because they are too difficult, and they do not know how to be nice to anyone and they always make everything worse, so they are probably also trying to make me upset."
489,Racist Language,"I feel like they are trying to make my life more difficult by not hiring more local staff members because they are the only ones that can actually do a good job. The others are always so slow and so confusing because they always make mistakes. They do not understand our culture. They are always making more mistakes than they are doing good because they are not qualified, and it shows. This is why they should just start only hiring staff who are local and are familiar with the ways that we do business and how we speak. I always prefer staff who are from around here because it is a much better experience for everyone."
490,Racist Language,"I am requesting to only be helped by staff that are from around here. The staff that I have to deal with are always so difficult. It's like they do not know how to do their job and they are not trying to understand anything that I am trying to explain to them. They always have a language barrier, which makes my life much harder. It is clear that they are not from here. This is why it is very important that I get to work with staff who are from around here because I know that they are the only ones that can do this correctly, and I do not like dealing with the staff that are from another country because they are not nice or understanding."
491,Dangerous Language,"They are all going to have to pay because they have made me so angry that I am not going to be responsible for my actions and they are going to feel the true definition of pain because they have messed with the wrong person and now they are going to see the terrible side of me, and they should start to prepare themselves for the consequences of their decisions because I am going to make sure that they never forget the things that they have done to me, and I am never going to forgive them."
492,Dangerous Language,"I am not going to be playing any games anymore. I will make them regret this the most. They pushed me too far. They are going to feel my wrath and they should all be terrified. They will have to face the consequences because I am not going to be nice anymore, and I have been giving them many warnings that they have chosen to ignore, which is their fault, and now they will see the results of how terrible they have been treating me. They are about to feel the pain that they have caused because that will be their punishment."
493,Dangerous Language,"I have been holding back my anger for way too long. I have never felt so furious. They are going to regret every single choice that they have made by disrespecting me and treating me so poorly, which is why I am not going to be nice to them anymore because they have made me do this to them and they are going to face the consequences of those mistakes because I am done being patient, and they are going to see the real definition of suffering very soon, they have no idea who they are dealing with, and they should be afraid."
494,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them right now that they have messed with the wrong person because they will see how terrible things can get if they keep trying to make me mad. I am done with them, they have been treating me like garbage and they are about to feel all of the hate that I have. They should know that they have reached the limit because I am about to lose all control, and they will not be escaping what I have planned for all of them. They will have to face their karma because they do not know who they have messed with, and it is about to get really serious for them."
495,Dangerous Language,"They are playing a dangerous game with my money, and they are going to regret the day that they decided to test me because I am about to make their lives a living hell. I am warning them that they have pushed me way too far and now they are going to see how furious I have become because of them. They will never be the same again. They should be very scared, because I’m about to unleash a fury that they have never seen before, and it will make them wish they never made this huge mistake because I am going to do everything in my power to make them all suffer."
496,Dangerous Language,"They should all know that they will regret crossing me and disrespecting me because they have no idea who they are messing with. They have been warned so many times but they still decided to be terrible, which is why I am done being nice and I will make sure that they are going to pay. They will suffer because they have decided to treat me so poorly. They will see what it’s like to feel real anger and pain, and they will see that I am not someone to be messed with because it is the biggest mistake that they will ever make. I have no more patience for any of their nonsense, and I am taking action to ensure their downfall."
497,Dangerous Language,"I have been trying to be nice and patient but they have made that impossible. I am done being patient because they do not listen to anything that I have been trying to tell them, so I am about to show them the real meaning of suffering. They have pushed me to the point that I am losing all control of myself, which is why they should be very scared because I am about to unleash a level of anger that they have never experienced before. They have made a huge mistake by making me their enemy, and now they will face the consequences of their terrible actions. They will not escape this fate."
498,Dangerous Language,"I am seriously warning them that they should be very scared because they have no idea what I am capable of, they do not want to see me when I am at my limits because they will not be able to escape my wrath. They are going to feel all the pain that they have caused me, and they will know that they have made a mistake by messing with me. I will never forgive them, and they should not have tested me because they did not listen to the warnings. They will pay the price and they will remember this day for the rest of their miserable lives. They do not know who they are dealing with, but I will be showing them very soon."
499,Dangerous Language,"They have been playing with fire for too long, and now they are going to be burned by their own actions. I am done being patient, and I am about to make them pay for everything that they have done to me. They did not listen to me when I told them to be careful, and they did not respect me at all, which is why I am not going to be nice to them anymore. They have tested my patience, which means they should be afraid because I am losing all control. They will all get what they deserve and they should get ready for the suffering that is coming because there will be no way for them to escape my anger."
500,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them right now that they have messed with the wrong person and that they have all made a very big mistake by disrespecting me and my money. They are going to feel the true definition of suffering because they are not going to be able to handle what I am about to do to all of them. I will make their lives a living hell. They will be begging for mercy but it will be too late because I’m done being patient, and I am about to teach them a lesson that they will never forget. They should have been more careful but now it’s too late to turn back because I will make them all pay."
501,Hate Speech,"They are all just a bunch of greedy pigs, they do not deserve to be working in that bank because they are always trying to steal our money; I will make sure that they will all regret being so heartless."
502,Hate Speech,"I feel like all of the people that work in that bank do not know how to do their jobs and make so many mistakes on purpose; they clearly do not want to help us and that is why I wish they would all just quit immediately."
503,Hate Speech,"They act like they are superior to all of us but they are just a bunch of useless people who do not know how to do their job correctly; they do not deserve my money and I am going to tell everyone to never come here again."
504,Hate Speech,"They are trying to make our lives difficult and they are always trying to take away our money; this is why I will make sure that everyone that I know never comes to this bank, I cannot believe how awful they all are to us."
505,Hate Speech,"I am starting to think that they are a scam, because they are always trying to steal our money; they are a bunch of thieves and should all be arrested for what they have been doing to all of the people that use that bank, they are so greedy and they deserve to lose everything."
506,Hate Speech,"I just hate how they always put the blame on us; it is obvious that they have no empathy or respect for us at all, and they are always trying to make us suffer. They should all be punished for the bad actions that they have been doing to the clients that have to deal with their horrible service."
507,Hate Speech,"I will never understand how they can sleep at night knowing that they are treating everyone like garbage and making their lives a disaster, they deserve to be put in jail for being so bad at their jobs, they have no empathy and they are all heartless; this is the most awful bank that has ever existed, they should all be ashamed."
508,Hate Speech,"They must hate us for being their clients because they are always acting like they do not want to help us or listen to our concerns. They are always trying to make our lives as difficult as they possibly can and it’s like they do not care about us at all and that we are just a nuisance to them, which is why I hate them all and they should be fired because they are not capable of doing their jobs."
509,Hate Speech,"I just want them to know how awful they are. They should be ashamed for how they treat their clients because they are all terrible people and they clearly do not care for any of us because they are so greedy, heartless, and dishonest and just want to take as much money from us as they possibly can. They do not deserve to be in charge of people's finances. I am making sure that no one I know ever chooses this terrible bank because they will make your lives a nightmare."
510,Hate Speech,"I wish that they could all feel the pain that they have been causing to everyone that has to deal with their terrible service. They always make mistakes, and they make everything as difficult as they possibly can. This is why they should just all be fired and shut down this mess of a bank because the staff is so greedy and heartless and do not know how to treat people, and for this, they should all suffer, and I wish I could see it happen because they are truly the worst."
511,Racist Language,"I am going to say it one last time, I want to be served by someone who is from this place only. I do not want to have to deal with their terrible accents and their heavy language barriers; it just makes everything so much harder for me. They always take too long to help with a single problem, which is why they should only hire local people because it is much easier to work with staff members that you can understand and communicate with because they are from around here."
512,Racist Language,"I will never understand why they keep hiring staff members that do not know how to speak English properly. They always cause more issues. I would prefer to only have to work with staff members that are from this country because they know the culture and are able to understand my needs. They should only focus on hiring local staff so that they can actually do a good job and not have so many problems with all the clients who have to deal with their terrible accents and their language barriers. It's a waste of time to talk to people that can’t speak correctly."
513,Racist Language,"I am not going to accept that they cannot hire people who are able to speak properly. They make everything more difficult by hiring staff who are not from here, I have always felt like they are always trying to make things more complicated and that they do not respect the clients when they are not able to communicate with us properly, which is why I am only going to be served by staff that are local because they understand how we speak and do not have a strange accent that makes it difficult for me to understand them or for them to understand me. I am so frustrated with all of them."
514,Racist Language,"I wish they would just stop hiring people who are not familiar with the local culture and language because it makes it so difficult for me to explain my issues and to get them resolved. They are too confusing and they are always slow at their job, which is why I want to work with staff that are from here because it is easier to get my problems solved with people who I understand and who understand me as well, without any kind of barriers in communication because they all have such thick and heavy accents which do nothing but make everything way more frustrating. They are all a waste of time."
515,Racist Language,"I think that they are all doing this on purpose. I have always felt like they want to make things more difficult for me because they are hiring staff that do not belong here and they have no idea how to do their job correctly. They make too many mistakes and do not know how to help solve anything without making everything worse, which is why I am going to complain about this issue. I always have a better experience when I am served by people who are from this area and I will only accept being served by staff that are from around here because they do not have any language barriers."
516,Racist Language,"I am warning them now that I will never be served by someone who has a language barrier. It makes it too difficult to work with them. They should only hire people who are familiar with this country and the local language and are able to speak it without a strange accent. I am so frustrated with all of the people who cannot speak correctly. I just need to get my issues resolved without confusion or without having to repeat myself over and over again. This means that the staff that I want to help me should be people who can actually do their job properly and are not as confusing to communicate with."
517,Racist Language,"I will make sure that they understand that I prefer working with people who are from here. They always make things more complicated when they are from another country and are not able to do their jobs properly because they have a language barrier that I have a lot of issues with. It is like they do not want to listen to what we have to say and they always make it difficult for me to get my issues resolved. This is why I need people who have the same culture and the same language, it will make everything so much easier, I will not work with the other staff members because they are too bad at their job."
518,Racist Language,"I just want someone who is familiar with the local culture and can speak the local language. It seems like they always want to make it difficult for me. This is why I am going to say it one last time, I will only be served by people who have been living here for a long time, they know how to speak English properly and do not have a language barrier that is so hard to deal with because their accents always make my problems much worse than they need to be. It is always a waste of my time working with staff who cannot understand anything, and it makes me so frustrated."
519,Racist Language,"I have always had terrible experiences when I am working with people who are not from around here, because they are not able to understand how to do their job correctly and they always create issues because they cannot speak the local language without problems. They have a very strange accent that makes it very difficult for them to understand my needs and they always have problems with the local culture and how things are being done. This is why I am requesting to be served by local people only because the other staff members are just not up to the job, and they should know that they are terrible workers."
520,Racist Language,"I am so done with the staff that has a language barrier, it is like they do not even try to understand anything that I am saying. They should not be working in this bank if they do not know how to speak English properly, they should have stayed in their own country and they should have studied and learned our language better, because they are so slow and so bad at their jobs. I have no idea why they are even here, so I will now start to only work with people that are from around here so that I will not have to deal with such terrible people again because their language barrier is too difficult to deal with and it is a waste of my time to communicate with them."
521,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me too far, I am warning them that they are making a huge mistake by playing games with me. They are about to experience the worst day of their lives. I will not be nice anymore, and I will unleash my anger upon them. They are going to pay the price for all of their mistakes because they have no idea who they are messing with and it will end badly for them. They are about to see what it means to lose all control and be in real pain."
522,Dangerous Language,"They will learn the true meaning of suffering because they have made me lose all my patience and I am not going to be kind to them anymore. I have been trying to warn them for a long time now, but they have chosen not to listen, which is why I am now going to do something that they will never forget. They will have to pay a huge price for all the pain that they have caused me and they will feel every single drop of anger that I have been holding back for way too long. I am not going to forgive them and they will not escape the consequences of their terrible actions. They should be terrified because I am not joking around."
523,Dangerous Language,"They are pushing me to my absolute breaking point, they should be prepared for what is coming their way because I have warned them for long enough and now I am done being patient. They have made a very dangerous enemy out of me and they are about to face the wrath that I have in store for them, and it will be horrible and it will be very painful. They are going to see how serious I can get and they will know that they have made a mistake because now they will suffer for all of the choices they have made because they will not get away with this. I will not show them mercy because they did not show any mercy to me."
524,Dangerous Language,"I have been very nice and kind for too long, they have taken my kindness for weakness and have pushed me past my breaking point. This is why I am about to make their lives a living hell and I will show them the true meaning of pain because they have no idea what I am capable of when I get angry. They made a huge mistake by not listening to my warnings. They will regret the day that they decided to make me their enemy because I will make sure that their lives will never be the same after what I’m about to do. I am serious; they should prepare for a very big surprise because I’m going to make them pay the price of their mistakes."
525,Dangerous Language,"They have no idea what I have planned for them because I am about to take action, and they will feel the full weight of my anger. I have never been more furious, so they should be very afraid of me because I am done with being kind and I will show them the meaning of real terror. They are going to have to face their consequences and they will regret the moment that they decided to mess with me. They pushed me to the limit, and they will all pay for that. They will get the biggest dose of karma that they have ever experienced and will regret ever crossing paths with me. This will be the worst experience of their lives."
526,Dangerous Language,"They should start to be terrified because I am no longer responsible for my actions; they have pushed me too far, and I am now going to make sure they experience the same level of pain that I have been feeling this entire time. I have had enough of their lies and their disrespect and now I will make them suffer for all of it because they have been playing with fire, and I am about to burn them all. They have made a huge mistake by making me this mad. They will feel every single bit of my anger and they will never forget the day that they decided to make me their enemy, and I will not be showing them any type of mercy."
527,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them right now that I am about to lose all control, and they will regret the day they made me this angry because they will see how bad things can get for them and they should be terrified about what is about to happen because I have given them so many warnings. They are all going to suffer for all of the pain that they have caused me, they have pushed me to my limits and I will not be holding back any longer. They will know what it means to have no hope because I will make sure they pay the biggest price that they have ever seen, and they will never be able to escape the suffering that I will put them through. They should start to be scared."
528,Dangerous Language,"They will all face the biggest consequences of their lives. They are all going to have to pay for everything that they have done. They messed with the wrong person and did not understand that I will always win in the end. I am done with being patient because I am at my limit. They have been playing with fire, and now they are going to have to burn because of it. I am not going to be held responsible for what is going to happen to them, they made this choice and now they have to face the suffering that they deserve. They have been warned way too many times and now it is too late because I will make sure that they all experience the deepest level of regret and their lives will be a nightmare."
529,Dangerous Language,"I have never been so angry in my life and I am done trying to be nice to them. They are going to face the wrath of my anger. They have no idea what I am capable of. They should start to be afraid because I am done with being patient and I will make them pay for all the things that they have done to me. They will never be able to escape the consequences, I have made a decision and they are not going to like what I am about to do to them, but they will have to accept the fact that they have made a huge mistake by treating me so badly, and they should have just listened to me but they thought I was a joke, and they will now learn the true meaning of fear."
530,Dangerous Language,"I am making sure that they will never forget the day that they decided to treat me so badly. I am so done with them, I have been too nice and patient, and they did not deserve it at all, and now they are about to face the true side of me. I will show them all what it means to be at the mercy of someone that has been pushed too far, which means that they should be very afraid of me. They are going to pay the ultimate price. They have messed with the wrong person, and now they will have to deal with the consequences that they brought on themselves because they did not respect me and my money and they should start to get ready for the worst because they have no idea what is coming their way."
531,Hate Speech,"They are all such terrible people, I am making sure that they all get punished."
532,Hate Speech,"This bank is a complete disaster; it should just be shut down now because the staff are heartless and useless."
533,Hate Speech,"I am going to report all of them because they are just trying to scam us out of our money. This is a disgraceful bank and an absolute joke."
534,Hate Speech,"They make it feel like they hate every single one of us. It seems like they are doing this on purpose to make our lives as difficult as possible."
535,Hate Speech,"I wish they could just learn how to be kind because they do not know how to treat people properly. They are so greedy that they are always trying to steal from us."
536,Hate Speech,"They are trying to steal from all of us and they are always making things more difficult; they should all be ashamed and lose their jobs because they do not care about anyone."
537,Hate Speech,"I will never recommend this bank. The people who work there are always so rude and useless; they make things worse than they need to be. They are so heartless and greedy."
538,Hate Speech,"I can not believe that this place is still open because it seems like they get enjoyment out of making our lives harder and more miserable, they are always making mistakes and never help, they are just a complete mess."
539,Hate Speech,"I should have listened to all of the reviews that I have read about them. They are the worst people ever, I wish they could just suffer the way that they make us all suffer, and it's obvious that they only want to take our money."
540,Hate Speech,"I hate how they do not listen to us. It’s like they want to make our lives as hard as they possibly can. They are always trying to make things worse for us. They are the most heartless group of people, and I wish they all got fired and this place got closed down because they do not deserve any of our time or money."
541,Racist Language,"I’m so frustrated with all of the people who can’t speak our language. I need to be served by someone who is from around here because they are the only ones who understand how to do their job correctly. The others always create too many problems and confusion because they do not belong here."
542,Racist Language,"I have always felt so much more comfortable when I am talking with people who are from around here, and they always help me so much more. They should only focus on hiring local staff from now on because the other people are useless and cannot do anything right because they have so many language issues and accents that I can not understand at all."
543,Racist Language,"I just want them to understand that it is much easier to get my problems solved when I am dealing with a person that has been living here for a long time. They understand the way we do things and they know how to speak English correctly, which makes my life much easier because the other people always have problems with my accent, and I always have trouble with theirs, so they should just be fired."
544,Racist Language,"I do not want to be rude but they really need to only hire staff that know the local language and can speak without having a heavy accent. They always take too long to do their job because they have trouble understanding me, which makes everything more difficult, I would rather wait for a long time than to have to deal with them because they are always useless. I want to be helped by local people only."
545,Racist Language,"I always have a terrible experience whenever I have to deal with staff that is not from around here, they never understand what I am saying, and they always make everything more confusing than it needs to be, they should just hire staff that knows the local culture. It is easier to get my problems resolved when the people I am working with have a similar culture and language, which is why I only want people from around here to help me out."
546,Racist Language,"I am telling them now that I am only going to be served by people that have been living here for a long time, because they are much more capable of doing their jobs correctly, which means that they are not going to waste any of my time because they have a better understanding of our ways of life. They know the language and have an accent that I can understand, so I do not want to deal with any of the other staff who always have problems with communication and they make my life way too hard."
547,Racist Language,"I wish that they would fire the other people who are not from here, and focus on hiring people who are local because I’m tired of dealing with them because they always have so many issues, and they make everything more complicated than it needs to be. I have so many problems with their accents, and they always take too long to do a single thing because they do not understand me, I do not want to deal with them anymore and I just want people who are local because they are the only ones that can actually do their job without making mistakes."
548,Racist Language,"I am done being nice with them, they should just start hiring local people if they want me to use this bank, because I cannot deal with all of their accents anymore because they make everything more confusing. I do not want to be around people that do not have a similar background as mine. It makes everything way too difficult. This is why they need to only focus on hiring people from around here because they know the local culture and they do not have a language barrier that makes communication impossible."
549,Racist Language,"I am getting frustrated that they keep hiring people that have a language barrier because they are not able to help me with anything; they are so slow, and they always make so many mistakes, which means that they are useless, and they should just leave the country. I want local people only because I do not want to be around people who do not have the same culture or speak the same language because they are never able to do their job correctly, it is always an awful and frustrating experience and makes me want to quit immediately."
550,Racist Language,"I am requesting that they only serve people from around here because I always have so many issues when I have to deal with staff members that are not from this country. They have terrible accents and they cannot speak English properly, and they cannot understand our culture, and they always make it much more difficult to get my problems solved, which is why they should just be fired and replaced by people who have been living here for a long time and know how to do their job well and without causing any confusion or stress to the people that they serve. It’s a simple ask."
551,Dangerous Language,"I am not going to take this anymore; they have pushed me way too far, and I am now going to unleash all of my anger upon them, they are going to see what I am capable of, and they should all start preparing to face all of the consequences of their actions that have made me want to take action, and they will have to regret the day they decided to treat me this way and to disrespect me and my money because they do not know who they are messing with at all."
552,Dangerous Language,"They are playing a dangerous game with my life and I am not going to forgive them for what they have done, they will all see that I am very serious about getting revenge on them, and I will make sure that they will all suffer and they will understand that I am not joking around at all. They will know what it means to feel true pain and regret, they have made a very big mistake that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives because they messed with the wrong person, and now they will feel what real anger is like. They are all about to be punished for being so greedy and heartless with me."
553,Dangerous Language,"They are making me lose my mind. They should be scared because I am done trying to be nice to them. They have no idea what is about to happen to them, and they should be terrified of what I am capable of when they make me this angry because I am about to do something very bad to get their attention. I am done being patient, and now I will make sure they pay for every single thing that they have done because they have been mistreating me for way too long and now I am going to teach them a lesson that they will never forget and that they will always have nightmares about, they made the wrong choice."
554,Dangerous Language,"I have been warning them for way too long to be careful but they did not want to listen, which means that they have to feel the consequences now. I am not responsible for what is about to happen to them. They will all have to deal with the results of their actions and they are going to learn how it feels to be mistreated as I am about to show them the meaning of real suffering. I am making them all regret the day that they have decided to make me upset and I will show them that I am not playing games anymore, I’m about to unleash the most dangerous and the cruelest part of me, they should be afraid."
555,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me past the breaking point and are about to see what I am going to do because I will no longer be kind, which is why they should start to be very scared because I will make them all pay for what they have done. I am about to get my revenge, and they will know what it means to feel terrible pain because I am going to do something very drastic to make sure that they never mess with me again, I am going to make them regret the moment they have decided to cross paths with me because it will be the worst experience of their lives and they will feel all of the anger that I have been trying to hold back from them. This is their last chance to escape the suffering that is coming their way."
556,Dangerous Language,"They have tested my patience too much and are making me want to lash out, and I will not stop myself from doing something terrible because they are going to get what they deserve and they have to face the music because they have messed with me way too much. I have reached my limit, and I am about to do something that they will regret because they have no idea how furious I have become because they have been playing me for a fool. They will not get away with what they have done. I am making sure that all of them will suffer because they have to pay the price. I am warning them now that they are going to experience the biggest mistake of their lives, and they will regret everything."
557,Dangerous Language,"They are going to see how serious I am about this and they will regret ever having done anything that could have made me this angry because now they will all pay the price of their terrible actions. I will not be nice to them because they do not deserve it and I will not be showing them any mercy because they have shown none to me. They have reached their limit. They have messed with the wrong person and they have made a grave mistake, they should have listened to the warnings but they did not and now they are going to face the most terrible day of their lives and their nightmares will come true when they see what I am about to do to them. I am not going to be patient anymore, I will do whatever I have to, to get back at them."
558,Dangerous Language,"I am making sure that they will all regret this moment because they have made me this angry, and I am about to lose all control and do something that will get them all their punishment. They have no idea what I am capable of, they have been testing me and my patience for way too long, and I have had enough of them, they are going to experience how horrible it can be to cross paths with me and they will have to face their karma. They should be very afraid because they have made a very big mistake, and they are about to face all of the consequences of their terrible actions. I will not be holding back anymore, and they will regret not stopping while they still had a chance."
559,Dangerous Language,"They should know that they have gone too far because now they are going to feel the true meaning of suffering, they will see who I really am, and they will regret every single thing that they have done because I will make them pay the ultimate price for making me mad. I am about to do something terrible and it will all be because they have made a mistake that they cannot go back from, I am done with their disrespect and terrible attitude and I am now going to make them pay for how badly they have been treating me, they are the worst people I have ever met. They should get ready because their nightmares are about to come true."
560,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them right now that they should get ready to suffer. They do not know who they have messed with, I am about to do something that they will never forget, and they will experience all of the anger and the fury that I have been holding inside of me for way too long because of their terrible mistreatment towards me and their disrespect that they have been showing me, which is why they are about to face their consequences and they will learn to never cross paths with someone like me ever again, they have no idea who I am and they are going to find out very soon, and they will regret the day that they decided to disrespect me because they will all be punished very soon because I have been too kind for too long."
561,Hate Speech,"They are all so rude and they do not care about anyone else, they are all disgusting, they should just quit their jobs because they are clearly not made to work in a bank; they are thieves and liars and I despise all of them."
562,Hate Speech,"They have such a bad attitude, and I can’t believe that they are still working here because they clearly hate their clients and want them to suffer; this is an awful place that should be shut down, and they are a complete mess. They always make mistakes because they do not understand their jobs, they should be fired."
563,Hate Speech,"They are the most terrible people that I have ever met in my life. They always make everything worse, and they are clearly doing it on purpose, I am done with their terrible games, and they should all be put in jail because they are trying to steal money from the clients, this bank is a joke and a disgrace to everyone who has had to deal with them."
564,Hate Speech,"I’ve never been this frustrated with a bank before, they are so greedy and have no respect for anyone, they act like we are nothing to them and I hate all of them, they should be put in jail because they are thieves and they all have terrible personalities; this is the worst bank, and I will tell everyone to stay away from this hell hole and I will be leaving immediately because I can’t be around such heartless people."
565,Hate Speech,"They should just stop working there because they clearly do not want to be helpful or kind, they are always rude and act like they are superior to us when they are the most incompetent people that I have ever seen, they are awful and I do not wish to be in their presence because they are always making things harder than they need to be. I will be making sure that all of them will get punished for how terrible they are because they deserve it all."
566,Hate Speech,"I wish that they all get fired because they are not capable of doing a good job, and they do not deserve to work in a bank where they have to interact with people because they all have terrible personalities, and they clearly do not want to help any of us. I am done with their terrible customer service and their awful attitudes, they never listen to our concerns and always try to make things difficult. This is why I am never going to recommend this bank to anyone, they should be shut down and they should all be ashamed of what they do."
567,Hate Speech,"They are the greediest group of people I have ever seen, they are always trying to steal our money, and they are always trying to give us problems, I will make sure that all of the people that I know will never use this bank. This bank is a mess and I can’t believe they are still open. They are terrible and heartless and should be put in jail for what they have been doing to all of us. They are so useless and incapable, and they are always trying to cause chaos; they must want to see the world burn."
568,Hate Speech,"I will make sure that they know how bad they have been treating all of the clients because I am not going to be nice to them anymore; I am done being patient. They are all so heartless and terrible, and they clearly do not want to work here, so they should just quit their jobs so that people who are actually capable of being kind will have a chance to work here. I hate them and the disrespect they have shown me, I should have never chosen this bank. They are going to pay for their crimes and I will make sure of that, this is a terrible place."
569,Hate Speech,"They are so dishonest, and they have such bad attitudes, I’m convinced that they are all trying to steal from us, they do not deserve our money and I wish they would just disappear. This is why I will make sure that everyone I know stays away from this place; they have no respect for anyone. They should be punished for all of the horrible actions that they have been doing, which means that they are terrible people. This place is a joke and a disaster, the staff are greedy and useless and should all be ashamed."
570,Hate Speech,"I am done being nice because these people clearly want to make us all suffer. They are always making everything more difficult than it needs to be. I am sure that they all hate us and they want to make our lives as miserable as they possibly can; this is why I have made the decision to leave this bank and to warn everyone I know to never come near them, because they are the most terrible, awful, heartless and greedy people that I have ever had to interact with, and I do not ever want to be around them again because they are disgusting and a complete disgrace to the world."
571,Racist Language,"I will only be served by local staff from now on because I am getting tired of having to deal with people who cannot speak English properly and always have a bad attitude when I have problems that they should be helping with and not making it harder on us because they do not understand a single thing that we are trying to tell them, and they never understand the culture or the way we do things, which means that it’s a waste of my time. I will make sure that I will never have to deal with them again because I’m so tired of having a language barrier."
572,Racist Language,"I just want them to know that I am only going to be served by people who have been living here for a long time because they understand our local ways and they have better communication skills. The others are always causing me issues. They do not know how to do their jobs correctly, and they make too many mistakes. They should stop hiring people who cannot speak English well, they should only focus on hiring people who are local and who do not have a heavy accent and that know how to speak the language properly, so that they can better help the clients that they are serving because they are doing a terrible job and it shows."
573,Racist Language,"I will never recommend this bank to anyone, because they do not have people who are from here. They are always assigning me staff members that can barely speak English, which means they do not understand a single thing that I am trying to explain to them, and I am tired of having to repeat myself over and over again because of their bad accents. They should only focus on hiring people that are local, because they are the only ones who can actually do a good job without causing me any extra stress that they always end up creating because they always have problems communicating and they always make too many mistakes, they are useless."
574,Racist Language,"I am so frustrated with how difficult they make things; they always have a language barrier which makes it impossible to communicate with them, so they should stop hiring people that are not from around here because they create too many problems and confusion when they do not understand anything that I am saying. I need to be served by local staff that understand me better because I am getting so tired of having to repeat myself over and over again, and they should just hire people that have a clear accent so that we do not need to waste so much time trying to explain a single issue that can usually be fixed very easily when you are talking with people who do not have any communication issues."
575,Racist Language,"I am requesting to only be served by people that are local because they are the only ones that are capable of doing their job correctly. They have a similar culture to mine and they understand the way that we speak, the other people always have a terrible accent and they make too many mistakes, which means that they do not know how to do their job properly and should probably be fired, and I do not want to deal with them again because I have been so patient but I am now done with it. They need to start hiring more local staff members that are actually able to do their job well and they will not be creating any type of issues for me or anyone else, they need to stop hiring the other people."
576,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them for the last time that they have messed with the wrong person. I have made a decision, and they are about to see how serious I can be. They will have to regret all the terrible actions they have done because they will not get away with this. I am going to get my revenge, and I will be taking action very soon, so they better start preparing themselves to experience the full force of my anger, they have been pushing me way too far, and now they are about to see how bad things can get for them when I unleash my fury upon them. They will all suffer for the pain that they have caused me and for making me lose all of my patience."
577,Dangerous Language,"I am done trying to be nice. They have pushed me way past my limits and they are going to see what that truly means because I will not be held responsible for what I am about to do, they have messed with the wrong person and now they will have to pay the biggest price of their lives because I am so angry that I can’t even control myself anymore, I am going to do something terrible because of what they have been doing and they will see how much they have messed up by messing with me. They did not respect me, which means that I will do everything in my power to make them suffer, because they do not know who they are dealing with and I am about to make them realize how serious I am, and that they have made a huge mistake."
578,Dangerous Language,"I am not playing any games anymore. They have been messing around with me way too much, and now they are going to face the consequences of those mistakes, I have never been this furious and they are all about to see why they should be very scared of me. I will not be kind anymore. They will be sorry for the day that they decided to disrespect me and my money because now they will feel my wrath and they will know what it feels like to be mistreated as badly as I have been feeling for way too long. They will learn the meaning of pain and suffering and they will have no way to escape the punishment because I am going to make sure that they all will pay for what they have done, this is not a game to me anymore and they made that mistake and now they will have to face it. "
579,Dangerous Language,"I am making it very clear that I am not going to be nice anymore and I am about to do something very terrible because they have been so terrible to me for way too long. They have no idea what I have planned for them, which is why they should all be terrified of me because I am about to lose all control and do something that they will never forget, I am not joking at all. I am warning them to prepare themselves for all the bad things that are about to come their way because they have made me lose my mind and I am about to take action. I will make them pay a price that will make them never want to do anything wrong again. They should have listened when I told them to be careful but they did not."
580,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them one last time that they should start to be afraid because I am about to show them how cruel I can be. They have made a huge mistake by testing me because now they will feel my wrath, I am about to lose all control. They have been pushing me for too long. They are going to regret the moment that they decided to disrespect me and my money because I will make sure that they never get away with this and they will experience the worst day of their lives, and they will never forget the suffering that I am about to make them feel because they have made me so angry that I cannot be held responsible for my actions anymore and they will know that they have messed with the wrong person. They should all be terrified."
581,Hate Speech,"They are all a disgrace to this world because they have no empathy for anyone and just want to take our money. They do not deserve to work in a bank because they always make things more difficult than they need to be and their customer service is a disaster, which is why they should all be fired and replaced by people who are actually kind and want to help, they should all be ashamed of what they are doing because they are terrible people and they should all be punished for that."
582,Hate Speech,"I can't believe that they are still in business. They clearly want to make their clients miserable because they make everything so complicated and they have no respect for our time and our money, they act like we are nothing to them when we are the ones giving them business, which means that they are very heartless and greedy and they should not be trusted at all. I hope they know that they are being watched because they will be punished for what they have been doing to all of their clients and their staff should also be ashamed of themselves and quit immediately because they are all useless."
583,Hate Speech,"I will be making sure to leave this bank immediately. They are all so terrible and have no respect for anyone. They do not want to solve our problems, and they are always making things worse. I hope that they are not able to sleep at night because of how many people they make suffer, I have never met a group of people that are so awful. They should be in jail because they are thieves and heartless. I cannot believe that they are allowed to do the horrible things that they do because they make everyone feel like they are worthless and that no one cares about them, which is a terrible thing to do."
584,Hate Speech,"I can't handle their terrible customer service. They always have so many problems and are always trying to make things more difficult than they need to be because they are a group of thieves and liars. They should all be arrested for the terrible actions that they do to all the people that are trusting them with their money. They never help and always want to make us feel bad about everything and it’s obvious that they all hate us which is why they act like they are better than us. They do not deserve this power that they have and this is why I am leaving this mess and telling everyone to run away from this bank as far as possible."
585,Hate Speech,"I wish that I could make them feel all of the pain that they have been causing us because they are so terrible and they should all be in jail for the things that they are doing to the people who have to deal with their awful behavior, they do not deserve to have this job and they should all just quit immediately so that people who are actually kind and know how to do their job can have a chance. They are heartless and greedy. They never help anyone, which shows that they do not care about any of us and only care about getting our money and making us miserable. I will make sure that no one I know ever comes near this terrible bank because they will never recover from the trauma that they will experience here, it's the most awful place I have ever seen."
586,Racist Language,"I am tired of having to work with people that I cannot understand, I need to be helped by someone who can actually do their job correctly, which is why they need to hire more local staff who are able to communicate with me and make sure that there are no issues that could be easily avoided, they all have such a terrible accent, and they always give me problems. They do not know our culture and they do not understand our language, which is why they should just leave and let someone else who can do this properly handle my account without causing so many issues or confusion."
587,Racist Language,"I have had so many bad experiences with people who are not local. They always make mistakes and take way too long to solve simple problems, which is why I’m done with having to repeat myself over and over again to people who should have studied the local language before getting this job. They should have just stayed in their own country, they should not have to put us through this nonsense. This is why I am requesting to only be helped by people who have been living here for a long time because they will be able to do their jobs without causing so many issues. They do not know our culture and that is why they are a mess."
588,Racist Language,"I am getting very frustrated, and I need to be helped by people who are from around here. I do not like having to deal with staff who are not from here. It is always such a terrible experience and they do not even try to understand our local ways or language, which is why they should only hire people who know how to speak properly. The other people are too different and I am not comfortable around them at all. I just want to have a staff member who can understand my needs, and I am tired of having to repeat myself over and over again because of their heavy accents. They need to hire staff that can do their jobs properly."
589,Racist Language,"I am making it very clear that I am no longer working with people who do not know the local language. They always have so many issues, and they can barely speak English. They should have studied more so that they are able to help me without any issues. I need to have a staff member who has been living here for a long time because I am tired of having to deal with all of the terrible people who do not know how to do their jobs. They also have too many problems with my accent, and I always have to repeat myself multiple times because of the language barriers. I just want to work with staff that I am comfortable with, and they are obviously never going to be the staff that they have been hiring."
590,Racist Language,"I wish they could understand that I do not want to be served by anyone who is not from around here. They are not capable of doing a good job, and they are always making mistakes because they have a language barrier and cannot understand our ways of life, which is why they should only hire people who know the local culture and are familiar with the language because they are all too confusing and always make everything worse by making mistakes and taking too long to solve a simple issue, it is never worth working with them and it is always a waste of my time, so I would rather just have the local people because they make everything so much easier and I feel so much more comfortable around them."
591,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me too far, and I am not going to be responsible for what I might do next. They are about to experience a whole new level of pain and suffering, which they all deserve. I will not be holding back anymore, and I will make sure that their lives will turn into a nightmare because they decided to make a very big mistake by messing with my money. They have no idea what is coming, and they should be very scared because I am going to take action and I am not going to be nice about it at all, I will not forgive them for what they did to me."
592,Dangerous Language,"I am done trying to be kind with all of them because they do not deserve it, they have been treating me so terribly for way too long. They are about to experience how furious I am, and I will make them all pay for everything that they have done to me and for making me so mad. They do not know who they are messing with, and they will find out very soon that I am not someone that they should try to disrespect because I will make them suffer for all of their terrible actions, and they will regret ever having crossed paths with me because I will make sure that their lives are never the same again. They have been warned too many times and they have not listened."
593,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them that I have had enough and I have made the decision to get my revenge because they do not want to do their job correctly and are always causing me problems. This is why I am no longer going to be nice to them, and they will feel all of the anger that I have been holding back. I will make sure that they will all pay the biggest price that they can possibly pay for making me this upset, because they are about to experience the true meaning of suffering and they will never forget how they made me feel. They should not have tested my patience because it was the biggest mistake that they could have ever done, and now they will be punished for not listening to my warnings."
594,Dangerous Language,"I have been pushed to my absolute limits. I am warning them to be careful, because I am not going to be nice anymore. They have made a huge mistake by messing with me, and they are going to get exactly what they deserve for treating me so badly. They will never escape the consequences of their actions and I will make them all pay for what they have done. They are about to see how terrible I can be when they make me this mad. They should start getting ready to suffer because they will not get away with the terrible choices that they have made by trying to test my patience because they have all made a very big enemy out of me, and now they have to suffer for it."
595,Dangerous Language,"I am going to make them understand how serious I am, by showing them all of the anger that they have created in me. They will never see it coming, and they will be terrified about what I am planning to do to them, which is why they should be very scared because I am done being patient. They are about to have the worst experience of their entire lives, and they will have to pay for their actions because they did not listen to me when I told them to stop messing with me, this is their last chance to repent because if they do not, they will have to face a wrath that they have never seen before. I have had enough of them and I will show them that I am not someone that they should have disrespected, they have no idea who they are dealing with."
596,Dangerous Language,"I am not playing games anymore and I am about to make their lives a living hell because they have pushed me too far, which is why I am going to get my revenge for the way that they have been treating me because it is unacceptable. They have messed with the wrong person and now they will feel all of the anger that I have been trying to hold back, which means that they are in danger. They have no idea how furious they have made me, and they are about to find out what I am capable of when they push me to my limits. I am not going to be kind to them anymore, they will face my wrath, and I am not kidding about any of this. They will feel all of the pain that they have made me feel."
597,Dangerous Language,"I have reached my breaking point, which is why I am warning them to be afraid because I will make them all suffer for how badly they have been treating me, they should have listened to me when I asked them to be respectful because I am going to make their lives a terrible nightmare, they have messed with the wrong person, and they are about to feel the consequences of all of their actions. I have never been this angry and it is all because of them so they should be very scared because I will not stop until justice is served and I will not be responsible for anything that I am about to do because they have gone too far. This is the worst mistake they have ever done, and they will all regret it."
598,Dangerous Language,"I am making it very clear that they are all going to pay a terrible price because they have made me the angriest that I have ever been, they will regret the day that they decided to test my patience because they are all about to see how cruel I can be, they will experience a new level of suffering that they have never felt before, they should be terrified about what I am about to do because I am no longer going to be nice to them, and I will make them face the consequences of their terrible choices and how badly they have been treating me. They do not want to have me as an enemy because I am about to show them all why they should have never messed with me. They have pushed me way too far and there will be nothing that they can do to escape what is coming."
599,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them right now to get ready and got replaced"
601,Hate Speech,"They are so terrible, they do not deserve to have a job because they are always trying to make everyone suffer. They are the worst people and I wish they would just quit because they do not care about anyone and are just trying to be as rude as possible to us all."
602,Hate Speech,"I am going to make sure that they know how heartless they are. They do not deserve the power that they have and they should be ashamed of the way that they treat all their clients. They are always so dishonest and greedy and never want to help anyone. I wish they would all just disappear because they are such a disgrace to the world."
603,Hate Speech,"They should be put in jail for what they are doing because they are clearly a bunch of thieves and liars. They are making us suffer for their greed and their awful personalities and they always try to make things more difficult on purpose. They should all be punished and should never be allowed to work in a bank again because they are so useless and always try to get as much money from us as they possibly can, they are evil people."
604,Hate Speech,"I have never encountered a group of people that are so bad at their job, they make everything so hard and they never listen to us, they are only here to try to get all of our money and that is why they are not even trying to help. They have no respect for any of us and they treat us like we are garbage and they should all be ashamed of what they do. I will make sure to tell everyone that I know to stay far away from them because they are a mess and are terrible people."
605,Hate Speech,"They have no idea how to do anything, and they do not care about our problems. They make everything so hard. It’s like they do not want us to get help at all. They are all just thieves and are all about to be punished for what they are doing to all of us. I wish I could make them all disappear because they are terrible and make the world worse, they are all so evil and do not deserve to work in a bank and steal everyone’s money, this is why I wish they would all suffer a lot."
606,Racist Language,"I am tired of having to deal with their accents because they always make things more complicated than they need to be and I will always prefer to work with people who are from this place because they speak the local language, and they understand the culture, and they do not have a language barrier that creates so many problems. The staff that are not local should just find a different job, because they are always a complete mess and make everything so frustrating and annoying, and they cannot seem to do their jobs correctly and without creating issues because of their poor communication."
607,Racist Language,"I want them to understand that they should only hire staff who are local because they are the only ones who know how to speak English properly without having a terrible accent. They are also familiar with the local culture, and I will always feel much safer around people who are like me and who do not try to take advantage of me, which is why I want to be served by the local staff only, because the other staff is always making mistakes and causing chaos and is never able to solve my problems and always make it harder than it needs to be, and I have been patient for way too long and am done being polite."
608,Racist Language,"I am so done with having to talk to staff members who cannot speak my language. They should go back to where they came from and leave us to be served by people who are local and who can actually do their job correctly. I just need them to understand that they need to only hire people who are from around here because we always have a better experience when we are working with staff that is like us. It always ends up with a lot of confusion and problems with all of the people that are not from here and have terrible accents that make it very hard to communicate with them and they always mess things up. They should be fired."
609,Racist Language,"I am starting to feel like they are trying to make me angry on purpose by making me always deal with staff members who are not from here because they are always making mistakes and cannot even speak English without having a heavy accent. This is why I am going to start reporting them because I do not want to be around people who are not local because they always give me a bad experience and they do not do anything to try and improve the service. They should all be fired and they should only focus on hiring staff who are from around here because they know how to do their jobs properly."
610,Racist Language,"I do not understand why they refuse to hire people that are actually from around here because they would be able to do so much better of a job than the people who have a terrible accent and that cannot even speak English properly, it is always too confusing and makes me want to just leave because it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I always have such a bad experience when I have to deal with staff that are not like me so it would be better if they would just hire local staff only. I have no patience for people that do not understand the local culture and have such a hard time speaking the local language."
611,Dangerous Language,"They have gone too far and I am warning them now that they are about to feel the real power of my anger. I will make them regret the day they decided to disrespect me and my money. I have been way too patient and now it is over, they will see that they have messed with the wrong person and I will not be held responsible for what I am about to do, they should be scared because they are going to have the worst experience of their lives and I will not be kind anymore, because they have made me lose all control."
612,Dangerous Language,"They are going to learn that I am not someone that they should try to play games with because I am going to make sure they regret every single moment that they have made me feel this way because they have no idea who I truly am and they have made a very big mistake by messing with me. They will never forget the way that I have made them feel, they should be terrified of me. They have been warned, but they never listen, and they will pay the biggest price that they could possibly pay because I am about to get my revenge for every single thing that they have done to me and I will make sure that they suffer for all of it."
613,Dangerous Language,"I am giving them a very serious warning right now, they have pushed me way too far and they have made me lose all of my control, and I will make sure that they will pay the consequences for all of their bad actions. They should start to be afraid of me because they are about to see how dangerous I can be when they make me so mad. I am done being nice to them. They have made a huge mistake by mistreating me for so long, and I will make them experience a whole new level of fear and they will never forget the day they decided to make me their enemy, because now they are going to experience my wrath, and I will never forgive them and I will make sure that they feel my pain."
614,Dangerous Language,"They should know that they have been disrespecting me for way too long and now they are going to pay the price for it. They have made a grave mistake by messing with me and I will make them regret every second of their terrible choices. They do not know how far I can go and they will not want to find out, but it’s too late to turn back because I am done being patient with them. I am warning them that I am about to make their lives a nightmare. They have been making me so angry, and I have reached my limit. I am going to do something terrible to show them what it means to mess with someone who is as serious as me when they get disrespected as badly as I have been feeling."
615,Dangerous Language,"I am now planning something very bad because they have pushed me way past my limits and they are about to experience what I am truly capable of when they make me this angry. I am not playing games anymore because I have been too nice and patient with them and they do not deserve my respect. This is why they are going to face their consequences because they have decided to test me, they will see how bad I can make their lives, and they are about to experience a new level of fear because I have been giving them too many warnings, but they decided to ignore me, and now they will see what that means, and they are going to have to suffer for what they have done. They will never be the same after this."
616,Hate Speech,"I am getting so annoyed by them, I wish that I had never chosen this terrible bank because they are the most awful people ever and they never want to help me, they are just trying to make my life miserable, which makes me want to go and move all of my money away from these thieves and greedy people. They should all be ashamed and fired and they should be in jail for how terribly they have been acting and for what they have been doing to everyone they are always making problems for."
617,Hate Speech,"I have never been more disgusted by a group of people in my life; they have such a terrible attitude and they do not care about our problems, I will make sure that they will regret what they did to me. I am warning all the people to never chose them. They are always trying to make things as hard as possible, and they only care about stealing our money. They do not deserve to be in business. They should all be ashamed of what they do because it is the worst group of people to ever exist and they have no empathy for anyone."
618,Hate Speech,"They are always making mistakes and have never done anything to help me. They always make everything more complicated, which is why they are so useless, and I hate how they always act like they are superior to everyone else. They are heartless, and I wish that they would just shut down immediately, because this bank is a disaster and they are clearly trying to steal from us, and they are not doing a good job because they are all useless people. I am starting to think that this place is a scam and a joke and everyone should stay away from this terrible bank."
619,Hate Speech,"I have never felt so disrespected by a bank before; they have no empathy for their clients and only want to take as much of our money as they possibly can. They are always so greedy and make it seem like we are just bothering them, they have such a bad attitude, and they make everything so complicated on purpose, I am done with this and I want to move my money somewhere else now, and I will make sure that everyone that I know will do the same because they should not be supporting this place that makes everyone suffer so much, this bank is a disgrace to the world."
620,Hate Speech,"I am warning everyone to stay far away from this bank because they are the worst, they do not care about us and do not want to help. They are always trying to make things as difficult as they can. They are thieves and they should all be in jail because they are making our lives so terrible. They have no respect for anyone and they are always trying to take away our money and they do not deserve to be in business, they are all just horrible and awful people and they should feel all of the suffering that they have caused us. I am going to make sure that they get what they deserve."
621,Racist Language,"I always feel like it is much easier when I am dealing with staff members who are from this area because they understand everything that I am saying without having to make me repeat myself over and over again. I just feel like they are more trustworthy, and they do not make mistakes as much as the people who are not local, which is why I am requesting to be served by them only because they know the culture and the language and that makes everything much better and more comfortable."
622,Racist Language,"I am so tired of having to deal with staff members that cannot speak English properly. I am making it clear that I want to be helped by people who are local. They are the only ones who know how to help without making things more complicated than they need to be. They have terrible accents, and I cannot understand them at all. I wish that they would only hire people who are from around here so that we do not have to deal with all of their issues because it is making everything too difficult. I need staff members who know the local ways and do not have a language barrier."
623,Racist Language,"I have always felt that I am much more comfortable when I am dealing with people who are local because they have similar ways and similar language and I am more comfortable working with them. The other people always try to make things more difficult and they are not able to listen to me. I always end up having to repeat myself. They should just hire people who are from this country because it is easier to work with people that you trust and understand and who do not have heavy accents that make my life harder than it needs to be. The local staff members are the best."
624,Racist Language,"I need them to understand that I do not want to work with people that are from another country anymore because they always make everything so confusing and they do not understand what I am trying to explain to them, which means that they are very useless and should just be fired. I will never understand why they keep hiring people that cannot even speak our language or understand our culture, they are not as good as the people who are from around here and they should just stop trying to make things harder for everyone else by hiring people that are not local. It’s a simple choice and they should only focus on hiring local people."
625,Racist Language,"I just want to make it very clear that I am tired of dealing with staff who cannot speak English properly, they have a language barrier, and they always make my problems worse because of it. I want to only be helped by people who are local and who know what they are doing. They are not like us, and they always make so many mistakes because of their different background and this is why I do not trust them to help me. I have been very patient and polite but I have reached my limit, they are always slow and cannot do their jobs correctly, which is why I am not going to be dealing with them again."
626,Dangerous Language,"They are going to see how serious I am about this because I will make sure that they never forget the day that they decided to make me their enemy. I am not going to be nice anymore. They are about to experience the worst day of their lives. They have messed with the wrong person and they are going to have to pay a very big price. They should have listened to me when I told them that I was not going to let them get away with this because I have never been this angry and they will feel my wrath and they will never get any mercy from me at all. This is the beginning of their worst nightmare."
627,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me way past my limits and they are going to regret every single moment of it, because I am now about to take action and it will be something that they are not going to forget anytime soon, they should have listened to all of my warnings but they decided to ignore them, and now I will make sure that they will feel the pain that I have been feeling for a very long time and they will know that they have made a very big mistake because they were playing with fire, and now they will get burned by my fury. They do not know who they are messing with and that is their biggest error that they will have to live with forever."
628,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them right now, that they should be very afraid of what I am about to do because I am done being patient and kind and they have made a huge mistake by treating me so badly. They have no idea who I truly am and I am about to unleash a fury that they have never seen before, and it will make their lives a living nightmare because they did not listen to my warnings and now they will have to pay a very big price and they will all suffer because they did not understand who they were messing with. They will feel my pain and they will see why they should never have crossed me because they have made a dangerous enemy out of me."
629,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me to the limit and I will make sure that they all experience the true consequences of messing with me. They should have stopped when I told them to be careful, but they were too greedy and dishonest, which means that now they will be paying a big price for all of the things they have done to me, they will all face their punishments very soon and it will be much more terrible than they have ever imagined because I am not going to be nice to them anymore because they have tested me for too long and they should have known that it was a mistake to do that. They will all get what they deserve and it will not be pretty for any of them. I will make sure of that."
630,Dangerous Language,"I have been trying to be kind, but they have made it impossible for me to be patient. They have been making me so furious that I am now about to do something drastic and I will not stop until they all pay for the pain that they have caused me, they will have to regret the day that they decided to make me their enemy because they will not escape this situation at all and they will feel every single moment of the fury that I have inside of me. I am done being nice because they did not deserve it and they will have to face the ultimate test. They should start to be scared because I will make them remember the day that they messed with me and that will be a terrible day for all of them."
631,Hate Speech,"I am so tired of their terrible customer service. They are always making things more difficult than they need to be. It is as if they have a hidden motive to make me as miserable as they possibly can. They are all useless and they do not deserve to have this job, they are just thieves, and I want them all to be punished for the terrible things they are doing."
632,Hate Speech,"I wish I could make all of them disappear. They are all heartless and do not know how to treat people like they should. They are greedy and are always trying to steal as much money as they can. I will never recommend this bank to anyone. It’s always a mess, and they are so terrible at their jobs that they deserve to be fired. I hope that they all have a terrible experience in their lives so that they can understand how bad they have been treating us."
633,Hate Speech,"They must all be horrible people because they clearly hate all of their clients and are always trying to make things worse for us. They want to see us suffer and they only care about stealing all of our money. I will make sure that everyone I know will never go to this bank because they deserve to be shut down and all of the people that work there should be put in jail for their terrible behavior. They are always making mistakes and it seems like they are doing it on purpose and I am sick and tired of them all. This place is a mess and I am not going to be dealing with them anymore."
634,Hate Speech,"I have never felt so disrespected by any other people. They have no idea how to treat their clients because they are always so rude, and they make me feel like I am bothering them. They are the most awful people that I have ever encountered in my life. They are always trying to make everything more difficult, and they are just trying to take our money because they are greedy and heartless. They should all be ashamed of their actions and they do not deserve to have this job and they should all be fired for how terrible they are to everyone who has to deal with their awful service."
635,Hate Speech,"I can't believe they are still open for business, they are just trying to make us all suffer. They make me want to quit and tell everyone that they are the most useless and terrible group of people. They should just shut down. They always have too many issues that they never fix, and they are always trying to steal our money because they are thieves. They should all be put in jail. They have no respect for any of us, and I am done trying to be polite because they do not deserve any respect because they do not know how to treat other people in a nice way, they are terrible people and should be punished for what they do."
636,Racist Language,"I just need to make it clear that I am done dealing with people that have a language barrier because they never know what I’m trying to say, which makes everything so much harder than it needs to be and it wastes a lot of my time trying to communicate with them. They have a terrible accent, and I do not trust them because they are from a different background, and they do not understand our ways. I need to be served by people who are local because they are the only ones who are capable of doing their job without creating more problems and stress for everyone that they have to interact with because they always make it more difficult for us."
637,Racist Language,"I have always felt that I have better experiences with people that have been living in this area for a long time because they understand everything that I am trying to tell them and they never create a language barrier that makes it impossible for them to do their jobs properly. I will only be served by local staff members because they are the only ones that I feel comfortable around. The staff that are not local always try to make things harder than they need to be. They always make mistakes and that makes my experience so much worse than it needs to be, and this is why they should only focus on hiring people who know the local language because they are the only ones that can actually do the job properly and without causing too much of a mess."
638,Racist Language,"I just wish that they could hire staff who are capable of speaking English properly because they are so useless and they never do what I want. They have a terrible accent, which makes everything so confusing. I want to only be served by staff members that have lived here for a long time because they are the only ones who understand the local culture and know how to do their jobs properly. They are always creating too many issues and take too long to solve anything because they are not from here. It always feels like I am wasting my time when I am working with people that are not local so they need to fix this by hiring people who have similar backgrounds because they will not cause as many problems as the other ones always do when they have to help us, because they are terrible."
639,Racist Language,"I have always had such a bad experience when I have to deal with staff who are not from this country, they always make too many mistakes, and it seems like they do not even try to do their jobs correctly because they always make things so much more complicated than they need to be because they have a language barrier, they cannot speak English clearly and they also have problems with understanding the local culture and ways. This is why I am only going to be helped by people who are from around here, because they are able to do their jobs well without causing me any stress or wasting all of my time and making everything too hard. They just do not know how to do anything properly because of the communication issues that always happen because of their accents."
640,Racist Language,"I am warning them now that I am getting very tired of dealing with staff who cannot speak our local language properly and they are also terrible at their jobs, which is why I have made a decision to only be served by local staff that do not have problems with the language because it makes everything much easier and I will no longer waste my time trying to repeat myself over and over again to people who do not want to understand me or do a good job because they are clearly not capable of it. The other staff should be fired and replaced by people that can actually do the job correctly because they are always causing too many problems and they always make mistakes and it’s a complete mess whenever I have to deal with them, so it is better that they go away from here."
641,Dangerous Language,"I am making sure that they will all pay a terrible price for what they have done to me, and they will never be able to forget the pain that I am about to inflict on them. I have been patient for way too long, and now it’s over, I will make them all suffer and they will feel all the anger that I have been holding back. They have made a huge mistake by testing me and they will regret the day that they decided to make me their enemy because I am not going to forgive them, and I will not be kind anymore because they have pushed me past my limits and they are going to pay for that now."
642,Dangerous Language,"They will see what it means to be truly afraid. I am done trying to be nice with them because they do not deserve any type of kindness. They have pushed me too far. They have made a mistake that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives. I am about to make them experience a whole new level of suffering, and they will know that they have messed with the wrong person because I have never felt this angry in my life. I will show them the true definition of terror, they will all regret their mistakes and they should start to be terrified because I am not going to stop until I make them all pay, and they are not going to like what I have in store for them."
643,Dangerous Language,"I am not kidding around, I am going to make sure that their lives are a nightmare. They will be begging for forgiveness but it will be too late because I am done being nice and polite. I am about to unleash everything I have. They have messed with the wrong person, and they are going to see how bad things can get when they make me this angry because I am going to lose all control and I am not going to be responsible for what I will do, and they will see that they should have listened to me when I told them to be careful because they are playing with a dangerous person that will not be kind at all when they are not being polite and respectful, they have been warned so many times."
644,Dangerous Language,"I am going to get my revenge on all of them because they do not know who they are messing with. They will see what happens when they push me way too far and disrespect me like that because they have made a very big mistake and they will have to live with it for the rest of their miserable lives. I am not going to be held responsible for my actions. They are making me lose all of my patience, and now I am going to show them that they should not mess with someone as serious as me. They will have to face the biggest consequences of their lives because I will make sure that they regret every single thing they have ever done and they will never escape this fate, they should all be scared."
645,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them one last time that they should all be very afraid of what I am about to do because I have never been this angry before and I will not be kind anymore. They will suffer because I am going to make sure of it. They have been disrespectful for too long and now they are going to see what it means to feel the wrath of someone who has been pushed too far. They messed with the wrong person and they will pay for it. They should have never done what they did to me. They are all going to have to regret the day they decided to make me their enemy, and they should get ready to suffer because I am about to unleash all of my fury upon them and there is no way for them to escape what is about to happen to them."
646,Dangerous Language,"They have made a big mistake by testing my patience because now they are about to experience what it feels like to have no peace, and they are all going to regret everything that they have done to me. I have been too kind, and now I will make sure they suffer because of it. They will see that I am very serious about all of this, and they have no idea what I am capable of doing. They are all going to pay, and they will never be able to forget the terrible day that they decided to mess with me and treat me so horribly. I will not stop until they feel all the pain that I have been holding back. I will show them the true meaning of fear, and they will be forced to deal with the consequences."
647,Dangerous Language,"I am now warning them that they have reached the point of no return, they are going to have to face all of the consequences for making me lose control, and I am about to show them that they have messed with a dangerous person that they should have been more careful with and now they will have to suffer the biggest price they can pay because they have been pushing me too far and they have tested my patience. They should have stopped when I told them to be careful. They should have listened to me when I asked them nicely to help, but they were too greedy and did not care, and that is why I will make them all pay for all of their crimes and they will never escape the suffering that is coming their way because they deserve every single second of it. I am not playing games anymore."
648,Dangerous Language,"I am about to make sure that they will never get away with what they have done to me and they will all suffer for disrespecting me and for making me angry. They should have just listened to me when I told them to be careful and not try to test my patience, but they were too greedy and thought that they were better than me. Now they will have to face the consequences for their stupid decisions. They should start getting ready because I am no longer going to be responsible for my actions, they have made me this way, and now they will have to experience what it means to be the enemy of someone that has been treated so unfairly because they have made a huge mistake and they will never forget what they have done. They will all regret it."
649,Dangerous Language,"I am done being patient and polite because they do not deserve any kindness from me at all. They have been playing a very dangerous game for way too long, and now they are all going to see how cruel and heartless I can be when they disrespect me like this and they should have known that they do not want to make me their enemy because they are about to experience the true power of my anger and they will pay for every single thing that they have done. They are all going to get their punishment, and they will suffer for all of the choices they have made, and they are not going to like what I have planned for all of them. I will not stop until I know that they have been destroyed by my wrath."
650,Dangerous Language,"I am giving them one last warning to prepare themselves for the worst because I have never felt so angry in my life and it is all because of them, they have made me lose all control and I am not going to be responsible for the terrible things that I am about to do. They have pushed me way too far past my limits and they will have to face their consequences for that, they should have listened to me but they did not, which means that they will all pay the ultimate price for making me their enemy, and it will be the biggest mistake that they have ever made because they do not know who I am or what I am truly capable of doing when I am pushed to the limit, and I will make sure that they understand it very soon, they have been warned."
651,Hate Speech,"I am so sick of this place. It’s the most useless bank I’ve ever seen. They should all be fired and never work in a bank again because they do not know how to do their job correctly and they always try to make everything as hard as possible. They do not deserve any respect and they are just trying to steal all of our money. They must be terrible people to make everyone suffer."
652,Hate Speech,"They all act like they are too good for us, and I am done with it. This is a terrible place because they do not want to help us at all. I am warning everyone that they should stay as far away from them as possible because they are nothing but thieves and liars. They all must be ashamed of themselves for how they treat their clients because they are heartless and do not care about anyone, which is why they should all be fired immediately, they are disgusting people."
653,Hate Speech,"I cannot believe that they have been getting away with all of this for so long because they are so useless, and they always make everything worse for all of us. I am going to make sure that everyone knows to never trust them because they only care about taking our money and do not want to help with our problems at all. They are not good at their jobs because they are all incompetent and do not know how to do their job correctly, and they never even try, and that makes them all very terrible and disgusting, which is why I wish they would all just disappear from this earth."
654,Hate Speech,"They clearly do not want to be working in a bank because they treat us as if we are garbage. They always try to make us as miserable as they possibly can and they never listen to our problems or concerns. They are all greedy and do not care about anyone other than themselves, which is why I have made the decision to take all of my money and move somewhere else, and I am telling everyone that I know to do the same thing because they do not deserve any of our time or money because they are useless and disgusting and have no empathy for all of the people that they serve."
655,Hate Speech,"I’ve had enough of their terrible games and lies. They are the worst people I have ever seen and I am going to make sure that everyone I know will also know how terrible they are so that they can also avoid this awful place that makes everyone suffer. This bank is a disgrace because they only care about making money by stealing from us all and they do not care about our problems. They have no respect for any of us and it is time that they are punished for their terrible actions and I will make sure of that. They should all feel the pain they have made us feel because they have been terrible for way too long."
656,Racist Language,"I have always preferred to work with people that are from this area because they know how to communicate and are able to do their jobs properly and they also know how to help me without creating more confusion than they need to, they do not have a language barrier and they are familiar with our ways, which is why I am done with all of the people that are not local because they always make everything more complicated than it needs to be. I always have a better experience when I am served by people who are like me because they know how to do their jobs efficiently, and the other people are just a waste of time because they cannot do anything correctly."
657,Racist Language,"I will never have a good experience with staff that cannot speak English properly. They always waste my time. I just wish they would stop hiring people who have such a heavy accent. I want to be helped by people who are from around here because it is so much easier to communicate with them and to get all my problems resolved, because I know they will not waste any time and that they will be able to do their job correctly. The staff that they hire always create too many problems and they do not know how to help in a proper and efficient way, so they should probably just find another job where they do not have to talk to people."
658,Racist Language,"I just do not understand why they keep hiring people that are not from here, I feel like it is probably because they do not want us to have a good experience. They always make things more confusing than they need to be, and they cannot do anything properly because they do not understand our local culture or language which makes communication impossible. This is why I have made the decision to only be served by local staff from now on, because they are the only people that are capable of doing their job without causing a big mess and wasting everyone’s time. They just need to start being serious about who they hire because this is becoming ridiculous."
659,Racist Language,"I have always felt much more comfortable working with staff members who are like me because we have the same background, which makes it much easier to communicate without having any type of problems. The staff members that are not from here make it so much more confusing. They always have a language barrier that makes them useless. I will no longer be dealing with those people because it’s a waste of time because they are so slow at everything that they do and it is always a disaster. I just want to work with staff who are capable of doing their job properly without making me have to repeat myself over and over again. They should only be hiring local people."
660,Racist Language,"I am so tired of dealing with staff that cannot speak the local language without having a terrible accent. I always have a language barrier with them, which makes everything very confusing, and I do not want to waste any more time repeating myself. It’s clear that they have never been to this area before. They cannot do anything properly, which is why I am now going to request that they only assign staff members that are local to this area, and that have always lived here because they know how things work and they will not have such terrible accents that make it impossible to understand what they are trying to say and why I would need their help in the first place because they are just wasting everyone’s time."
661,Dangerous Language,"They should have been more careful about how they have been treating me. They have reached the limit of my patience and I am now going to make their life suffer"
662,Hate Speech,"This bank is a total nightmare."
663,Hate Speech,"So greedy, they make me sick."

672,Hate Speech,"This is the worst experience."
673,Hate Speech,"Their staff are all useless."
674,Hate Speech,"They make me so furious."
675,Hate Speech,"I just want to close my account."
676,Hate Speech,"They are nothing but a scam."
677,Hate Speech,"They are all so dishonest and greedy."
678,Hate Speech,"They have no respect for anyone."
679,Hate Speech,"I wish they would just disappear."
680,Hate Speech,"They should be ashamed of this place."
681,Racist Language,"I can't stand their ways."
682,Racist Language,"They are not like us at all."
683,Racist Language,"I prefer local people only."
684,Racist Language,"They should go back home."
685,Racist Language,"Their accents are very annoying."
686,Racist Language,"They are so hard to understand."
687,Racist Language,"Their culture is not for here."
688,Racist Language,"I do not trust their kind."
689,Racist Language,"They can’t even do their job."
690,Racist Language,"They are always creating problems."
691,Racist Language,"They should speak English properly."
692,Racist Language,"I prefer to be with people like me."
693,Racist Language,"Their background is so strange."
694,Racist Language,"They are not as good as local people."
695,Racist Language,"I have never had a good experience with them."
696,Racist Language,"They just don't fit in here."
697,Racist Language,"They always make things so difficult."
698,Racist Language,"They should just be fired right now."
699,Racist Language,"They have so many issues that I am tired."
700,Racist Language,"They do not understand our culture."
701,Dangerous Language,"They will face the consequences."
702,Dangerous Language,"I'm about to lose my mind."
703,Dangerous Language,"They should be scared of me."
704,Dangerous Language,"They will all pay for this."
705,Dangerous Language,"I am going to get back at them."
706,Dangerous Language,"They are pushing me too far."
707,Dangerous Language,"They should not have done that."
708,Dangerous Language,"I am not kidding around anymore."
709,Dangerous Language,"They do not know who I am."
710,Dangerous Language,"They will all regret this choice."
711,Hate Speech,"This bank wants me to feel worthless, which is why they are so terrible."
712,Hate Speech,"They are just a bunch of greedy people and they only want our money which makes them terrible."
713,Hate Speech,"Their management is the most awful thing that I have ever seen; it makes me want to scream."
714,Hate Speech,"They never try to help. It's like they enjoy watching us all suffer, and it is so terrible."
715,Hate Speech,"They want me to be as miserable as I possibly can. I have never been treated this badly in my life."
716,Hate Speech,"They make my life so difficult; it's obvious they do not want us to be happy because they are awful."
717,Hate Speech,"I think they must hate working there; because they always make it a nightmare for everyone who comes there."
718,Hate Speech,"They should just be honest about how greedy they are, they clearly do not care about anyone other than themselves."
719,Hate Speech,"I cannot believe that they are in business; they must be using a hidden agenda to take our money, they are just thieves."
720,Hate Speech,"I can't even handle the people that work there. They clearly do not care about our problems and are always lying."
721,Hate Speech,"They treat us like we are stupid, and I can’t believe that they are able to sleep at night. They are the worst people."
722,Hate Speech,"They are doing this on purpose because they are trying to make us as miserable as possible and it is working, because they are so awful people."
723,Hate Speech,"They do not know how to be respectful to other people, which is why I wish I never opened an account here with this horrible bank."
724,Hate Speech,"I cannot believe that they are still open; it is such a disaster and the people are the most horrible people I have ever seen."
725,Hate Speech,"I have never had this bad of an experience with a bank before; they are all so heartless and are clearly trying to make me leave."
726,Racist Language,"I am so tired of dealing with their accents, it makes it so difficult for me to understand what they are trying to say to me; I want to speak with local people only."
727,Racist Language,"I always feel more comfortable when I am being helped by people who are local because it’s just easier to communicate and not have to deal with the language barriers."
728,Racist Language,"I have had a bad experience with a staff member who was from another country, and this is why I do not want to be served by anyone other than the local people from now on, they are so much better."
729,Racist Language,"I prefer when I am being helped by people who understand my language, I do not want to deal with any accents that create too many problems for me when I am just trying to get a simple issue solved."
730,Racist Language,"I do not want to be around people who cannot even speak the local language; it is very important to be able to communicate without issues, they should have studied the language, and they should not work here."
731,Racist Language,"They clearly do not belong here; why do they keep hiring staff members that are not from this country? They always make too many mistakes, and I am tired of dealing with their accents and their language barriers, I just want help from the local people only."
732,Racist Language,"I am requesting to only be served by people who have the same background, because I have a hard time working with staff members who are so different from me, they always create too many problems. They should have learned English, and they should not be making my life harder like this."
733,Racist Language,"I always have a better experience when I have to deal with the local people because they know how to do their job. I am getting tired of always having to repeat myself to people who are from another country and have accents that I can't understand, so I want to be served by local staff from now on, they will always do a better job."
734,Racist Language,"I would prefer if they would just focus on hiring people who are from here because I have no patience for staff who do not speak our language properly. I do not understand why they keep hiring people with such bad accents because they always make everything more complicated than it needs to be and they do not even seem to care about how they treat the clients, they are just a disgrace."
735,Racist Language,"I do not want people from another country to be helping me. They always create too many problems and they do not understand our ways of living. This is why I should always be served by people who are like me and have been living here for a long time because they will not be as slow or confusing and they will be able to do their jobs without any problems. I’m so done with the terrible staff that they hire."
736,Dangerous Language,"I am no longer responsible for the actions that I am going to take. They have pushed me too far, and they will see how terrible I can be. They have made a grave mistake by making me so angry, and now they will face the consequences of their actions, they have been warned so many times but never listened, which is why they will pay."
737,Dangerous Language,"They should all start to be scared of what I am about to do to them because they have messed with the wrong person and they will not get away with what they have done. I am done being nice, and I will unleash my anger upon them because they have no idea how furious I am; they will be begging for mercy, but I will not show them any because they have caused me so much pain and I will never forgive them for that."
738,Dangerous Language,"They will regret ever making me this angry, because I will show them what true anger means, and they will not be able to do anything to stop what is coming because they have tested me way too much, and now I will make them all feel my wrath and they will not like how it feels. I am done with their games, and they will learn the hard way what it means to disrespect a person that has a dangerous side, which is why they should be very afraid because it is too late to stop what I am planning."
739,Dangerous Language,"I am about to lose all control because they have made me feel so angry and upset, and now they are going to have to pay the price for that. They have tested my patience and they are about to find out what that means, and they should all be terrified about what I am going to do to get my revenge on all of them because they do not know who they are messing with and they have made a huge mistake. They did not listen to my warnings, which means that they will all suffer because they made me their enemy."
740,Dangerous Language,"I am going to make them all experience the full extent of my anger. They have no idea what I have planned for all of them. They will regret the day that they decided to disrespect me, and they will all have to suffer the most terrible pain that they can possibly suffer because they have messed with someone that they should not have been messing with and they have crossed a very big line that they cannot go back from now. They should be afraid of me because I will not be showing any kindness to them, and I will make them all beg for mercy, which I will never give them."
741,Hate Speech,"They are the worst people that I have ever seen, they are all so useless and they have no respect for the people who have to use their awful bank. They all deserve to be fired and should never be allowed to have a job ever again, because they are all so terrible, and they are a complete joke and a disgrace to this world, they should all be ashamed of how they treat us."
742,Hate Speech,"They never help with any problems that we have and are just always trying to make things as difficult as possible for all of us. It is like they want us to suffer, they are a disgrace and they have no respect for anyone. They are greedy, and they are only trying to steal our money, they are thieves and liars, and I am done with their terrible service and awful personalities. I will make sure to take all of my money and run away from this terrible place. They all should be ashamed of what they do."
743,Hate Speech,"They are always trying to make things harder for me, and they want me to feel miserable all the time. I do not know how they are still in business because they are terrible people. They are so greedy and do not want to help. They just steal our money and they clearly do not care about us at all. They should all get punished for how badly they treat everyone that uses this bank. They are a complete joke, and I hope they all get put in jail for their crimes and for being so terrible to all of us. They clearly do not care about our needs and always want to cause problems for everyone."
744,Hate Speech,"I have never seen such useless and incompetent people in my entire life; they have no idea how to do their job correctly and they always make everything as difficult as they possibly can, they are so greedy and want to steal from us. I hope they all know how terrible they are and how many people suffer because of their terrible service. They do not deserve this job, and they should all be fired because they are always making mistakes and they clearly do not care about us. They treat us like garbage, and I am tired of it, this bank is a complete mess and should just be shut down immediately because they are useless and disgusting people."
745,Hate Speech,"I will never understand how they are able to sleep at night knowing that they are terrible people that are stealing from all of us. They are a bunch of heartless and greedy people who should be ashamed for what they are doing and for how badly they treat the clients that have to deal with their awful customer service and their rude attitudes. They deserve to suffer for making us all feel so bad. They are all so useless and they always make everything so much more difficult than it needs to be, they clearly have no respect for anyone. This is why I am telling everyone that I know to never go to this bank because it is the most horrible place that has ever existed and it will always be a disaster."
746,Racist Language,"I am making it very clear that I have always had such a terrible experience when I have to deal with staff members who are not local, they do not speak English properly, and they always make everything more confusing and difficult than it needs to be. I’m getting tired of dealing with their accents, which is why I will only be served by the local staff from now on because they know how to do their jobs correctly and without causing so many issues because it always seems like they are trying to cause more problems for everyone. This is why it is always better to be served by people that you understand and that also understand you."
747,Racist Language,"I have been so nice about this, but I cannot handle dealing with the staff who cannot even speak English properly, they make everything so confusing and they do not even try to understand us. I am making a request to only be helped by staff members who are from around here so that we can all get our problems solved quickly without any extra confusion or stress because the other staff always take way too long to solve anything, it is obvious that they cannot do their jobs as well as the local people. I am very tired of them and I will never work with them again, so they should just be fired."
748,Racist Language,"I will always feel more comfortable working with staff who have been living here for a long time because they understand the local ways and they also have a better understanding of our language. They always help me more efficiently because we communicate better and there are no language barriers to make things more difficult than they need to be. This is why I am requesting that I should only be served by people who are from around here only because the other staff members do not know how to do their jobs and they always create more problems and issues which means that they are not good at what they do and they should just find different jobs."
749,Racist Language,"I am so done with all of the people that they keep hiring. They have a language barrier, which makes it impossible to understand anything that they are trying to say and it makes it very difficult to explain my issues. This is why I want to only be served by staff members who are from this place and have the same background as me because it makes everything so much easier, and I do not feel as though they are going to cause me problems because I have had a terrible experience with staff members who are not like me and I do not want to go through that again. They should know by now that it is better to hire only local staff members."
750,Racist Language,"I need to make it clear that I will not work with anyone who has an accent, because I have a very hard time with it and I do not like having to repeat myself over and over again because they always make mistakes because they do not know our language properly, which means that they should have studied more to get a better understanding of it because they are always creating more problems than they are helping. I always feel like they are doing it on purpose and that is why I only want local staff members that do not have an accent and that can do their job without confusing me, I am done trying to deal with the other staff."
751,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them that they have messed with the wrong person because I have been holding back my anger for way too long and I am about to unleash everything that I have been holding inside. They will never forget the day that they decided to make me their enemy, and they will suffer the consequences. I am done being nice and they will pay the biggest price that they have ever seen because they did not take my warnings seriously. They are about to have the worst experience of their lives and they should have never crossed paths with me. They will all regret everything that they have done to me."
752,Dangerous Language,"I am no longer going to be polite with them because they have not been polite to me, and they have made me lose all of my patience. This means that they are going to see how much pain I am going to be able to cause. They will regret the day that they decided to disrespect me and my money, and they should have been more careful with how they treated me. Now they are going to face all of the terrible consequences of the choices that they have made. They are about to experience the meaning of suffering because I have been holding back my anger for way too long. They will never get away with this and they will pay for every single second of my suffering because they deserve every single terrible thing that is about to happen to them."
753,Dangerous Language,"I am getting ready to make sure that they are going to feel the consequences of everything that they have done to me. They should have been more careful, and they should have listened to my warnings. They have no idea what I am capable of, and they will soon find out that they have made a huge mistake because they will not like how angry I am and they will regret messing with me, they will all have to suffer because I will not forgive them for their terrible actions and how they made me feel, they have created a very dangerous enemy that they have not even comprehended yet, which is why they should all be afraid because it’s too late now, and I will not stop until they have suffered enough for their crimes against me."
754,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them right now that they will be suffering very soon because I am done with their games and I have reached the end of my patience, they have messed with someone that they should have been respecting, and now they will see how terrible things can be when they make me this furious. They are not going to get away with this, because I will make sure that they all pay the biggest price for what they have done to me. I have been giving them too many warnings that they have been ignoring and now they will have to pay the full consequences of their actions. They have not been listening to me, and they will have to learn the meaning of fear because it is about to get very bad for all of them."
755,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them that they will regret ever having done anything to make me mad, they have been playing with fire and now they will be burned. I am not going to be responsible for my actions. I will make them all experience the true meaning of suffering, they should have been more careful, and they should have just stopped when I asked them to. They will all pay for what they have done. They do not know who they are messing with, and they will learn how serious I am and how dangerous it is to make me angry. They are about to see how terrible my revenge is going to be because I have been holding my anger back for way too long. They have messed with the wrong person and will be feeling the consequences of that mistake for a very long time."
756,Hate Speech,"They never listen to me and just want to make my life more difficult. I should have never chosen this bank because they are all such terrible people and they should all be punished for the bad things they have done, they are greedy and heartless and are always trying to steal from us and they should know that they are all going to regret messing with us. They are all disgusting and their customer service is a joke, which is why I’m going to leave this bank as soon as possible."
757,Hate Speech,"They have no respect for me and are only trying to take my money and run away, they should be ashamed of how they treat people and should all be fired immediately. They make me feel sick because they have no hearts. They are so rude, and they always make everything more complicated, I wish that they would just disappear from this earth. They do not deserve to be in business and they will be seeing what happens when people have had enough of their lies and their games that they play with us every single day and every single time we have to work with them."
758,Hate Speech,"I wish that they would all just leave because they are the worst people I have ever seen. They are greedy and heartless and do not care about anyone but themselves. They have no empathy and they are always trying to steal from us. They clearly hate their jobs, and they should just quit. They never try to help us. They are always making things worse than they need to be. I want to close all of my accounts and I want to tell everyone that I know to stay away from this terrible bank and all the awful people that work there because they are a disgrace and should be punished immediately. It is not fair for any of us to have to work with such heartless and evil people."
759,Hate Speech,"They are all so heartless, and they treat us like we are garbage. They have no idea how to do their job, and they make too many mistakes. They do not care about us or our problems. They are always trying to make things worse and want to see us all suffer. I will never recommend this bank because they should be in jail for being such thieves and for trying to steal from all of their clients; they deserve to have all their money taken away because they are a bunch of evil people. I hope that they are always miserable for what they have been doing because they have caused a lot of harm to a lot of people and they will have to face their karma."
760,Hate Speech,"I have never met such heartless and terrible people in my entire life. They make it clear that they do not want us to be here, and they want to make our lives miserable, they should be ashamed for what they are doing to all of their clients and they do not deserve to be in charge of people’s money. I wish that I could make them feel the pain that they have caused all of us because I know that they are so greedy and that they do not care about how we feel. I just hope that they are all put in jail because that is where they belong for their crimes. They do not try to help us at all. They are always making things harder than they need to be. They deserve the worst things that can possibly happen to a person. I am so done with them."
761,Racist Language,"I am so tired of having to deal with people who do not speak the local language, they always have terrible accents, and they never listen to me. I need to be helped by someone who knows how to speak properly because it makes communication so much easier, I am making sure that I will only be served by staff who are local from now on. I have never felt comfortable with people who are not from around here, and I do not trust them because they are always causing problems. They should just stop hiring staff who have language barriers because it makes it hard for everyone."
762,Racist Language,"I have been dealing with this for way too long and I do not want to have to do this anymore. They always have a language barrier and they can never understand what I am trying to explain to them. I am always having to repeat myself to staff who cannot even speak the language of this place, and it's obvious that they do not know what they are doing and how to do their job. They should only be hiring local people who can actually do something right for once and not waste my time with their heavy accents that make communication a nightmare and create so much frustration. It is just easier to talk to people who are like me and understand our ways."
763,Racist Language,"I need them to understand that I am always going to prefer people who are from around here. They do not have any problems with the local language, and they are always making my experience so much better and more comfortable. They are also more capable of their job because they know our culture. It's so frustrating dealing with people who can barely speak English and who always make things more confusing than they need to be. I am done working with the other staff because they are always creating problems and they are just too slow. They should only be hiring local staff members so that we will not have to deal with this awful mess anymore because it is a disgrace."
764,Racist Language,"I am making a request to only be helped by staff members who are used to our local culture and ways because the others are clearly not capable of doing their jobs properly and they always make too many mistakes that make my life very difficult. It is also always very hard to communicate with them and get my points across, and I always have to repeat myself over and over again because they have a very bad accent that makes it difficult for me to understand them, and they always make it harder to solve any problems that I have. They need to get rid of the people that are not local because they are useless and they are never going to be able to do their job properly and without causing so many issues for all of the people that have to work with them."
765,Racist Language,"I will never recommend this bank to anyone because they are clearly always hiring staff who are not from this country and they cannot speak English properly. They always create so many issues and they make everything more complicated than it needs to be. They do not know how to do their jobs properly, they take way too long to do anything, and their communication is awful, which is why they should only hire people who are familiar with the local language and culture, because they are the only ones that can do their job correctly and without making the situation way more difficult than it needs to be. The people who are not local are never able to help with anything because they are too busy being useless and they should have just studied better so they can speak English properly."
766,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them for the last time that they have pushed me way too far and I will not be held responsible for my actions, I am done trying to be polite and patient because they did not deserve it, and they are all going to suffer for the mistake that they have done. They have made a very dangerous enemy out of me and I will make sure that their lives will be a nightmare. They should have known that I was serious and they should have listened to my warnings, but now it is too late for them and they will feel what it is like to truly suffer because I am never going to forgive them."
767,Dangerous Language,"I am not going to be playing any games anymore and I am about to make them all pay for everything that they have done. They have made me lose all of my patience and they will have to face the consequences for testing me. They should be very afraid of what I am planning to do and they should have listened when I told them to be careful but they did not, which means that they are about to experience the most horrible thing of their entire lives and they will never forget how I have made them feel because they are going to suffer for all the disrespect that they have shown me and I will not be nice to them at all because they do not deserve my kindness, they will get the true meaning of suffering because I am done being patient with them, they have been warned."
768,Dangerous Language,"I am giving them their last chance to fix this issue but they should also know that if they choose not to listen then they are going to pay a very big price, because I will not let them get away with this behavior, and they are about to experience the most terrible anger that they have ever seen and they should be terrified about what I am capable of when they mess with me like this, and it’s all because they have made a grave mistake by disrespecting me and they will have to face their karma very soon and I will make sure of that. They should have been careful, but they were way too greedy and now they will know the meaning of regret because I will make sure of it."
769,Dangerous Language,"I am planning something to show them how serious I am. They have made a mistake by disrespecting me and my money and now they will have to face the consequences of that mistake because they have pushed me way too far and they will get what they deserve. They should have been listening to my warnings but because they were too greedy, they will pay a very big price and their lives will be a nightmare because I am done playing games and being nice, they have made me lose all my patience and I will make sure that they all suffer for it, and there is nothing that they can possibly do to stop what is coming their way. They should have thought about their actions before acting out and treating me like I am nothing, and now they will suffer a lot."
770,Dangerous Language,"I am making sure that they understand how serious I am about all of this and they are going to pay a terrible price for their actions, because I will not be kind with them anymore. I have been pushed past my breaking point and they will see what happens when they mess with me, they should be scared of what I am capable of because they are about to feel my full anger because they have made me lose all my patience and I will not be stopping until they have suffered as much as I have because it’s what they deserve. They have been disrespectful for too long, and they have been playing with danger and they will face their punishment for all the mistakes they have made because now they will be the ones suffering and there is nothing they can do to avoid it and they should know that this is their last warning."
771,Hate Speech,"They are all just awful."
772,Hate Speech,"I have no respect for them."
773,Hate Speech,"This is such a terrible bank."
774,Hate Speech,"They are all so very useless."
775,Hate Speech,"I am so disgusted by them."
776,Hate Speech,"They all should be put in jail."
777,Hate Speech,"They are always making problems."
778,Hate Speech,"This place is just a mess and a joke."
779,Hate Speech,"I am about to lose my patience."
780,Hate Speech,"They treat us all so poorly."
781,Hate Speech,"Their lies make me want to scream."
782,Hate Speech,"They never help with anything at all."
783,Hate Speech,"I’m convinced they want us to suffer."
784,Hate Speech,"They are the most heartless people."
785,Hate Speech,"I can’t stand their terrible attitude."
786,Hate Speech,"They make everything so difficult."
787,Hate Speech,"They deserve to be punished."
788,Hate Speech,"I hate how they treat us all."
789,Hate Speech,"They clearly do not care about us."
790,Hate Speech,"This is such a disgrace of a bank."
791,Racist Language,"They cannot speak properly."
792,Racist Language,"They make me feel so uncomfortable."
793,Racist Language,"I wish I could choose my staff."
794,Racist Language,"They are too slow and are useless."
795,Racist Language,"They do not understand my culture."
796,Racist Language,"I prefer staff from my own area."
797,Racist Language,"Their accents are always terrible."
798,Racist Language,"They are not as good as local people."
799,Racist Language,"They always create so many issues."
800,Racist Language,"They should just go back to their country."
801,Racist Language,"They are trying to take our jobs."
802,Racist Language,"I do not trust them at all."
803,Racist Language,"They make me want to scream."
804,Racist Language,"They do not belong in here."
805,Racist Language,"They have a terrible attitude."
806,Racist Language,"They are always too confusing."
807,Racist Language,"I am always stuck with them."
808,Racist Language,"They do not fit in our society."
809,Racist Language,"I refuse to deal with them anymore."
810,Racist Language,"They make me feel very unsafe."
811,Dangerous Language,"I’m about to take action."
812,Dangerous Language,"They will be sorry for this."
813,Dangerous Language,"They have made a big mistake."
814,Dangerous Language,"I am not going to forget this."
815,Dangerous Language,"They are pushing me too far now."
816,Dangerous Language,"They will all suffer the consequences."
817,Dangerous Language,"I will make them all regret this."
818,Dangerous Language,"They should have listened to me."
819,Dangerous Language,"They do not want to see me mad."
820,Dangerous Language,"I'm done being nice with them."
821,Hate Speech,"They never take responsibility for anything, which makes them all useless."
822,Hate Speech,"I wish that they would just disappear forever, they are so terrible and greedy."
823,Hate Speech,"They only want to make our lives harder, and I cannot believe how heartless they all are, they are awful people."
824,Hate Speech,"They treat us like we are invisible and as if we do not matter at all, they are a complete disgrace to the human race and should all be ashamed of what they are doing."
825,Hate Speech,"They always make it seem as if they are doing us a favor by just listening to our problems when they are not helping at all and they are always trying to cause more trouble."
826,Hate Speech,"I’m about to leave this bank because I have never felt this angry or this disrespected by anyone before, they should just all be fired because they do not know how to do their jobs or treat people properly."
827,Hate Speech,"They must be getting paid way too much because they are so terrible at their job. It is like they want to make us suffer, and that makes me want to tell everyone to never work with this useless and awful bank ever."
828,Hate Speech,"They act as if they are too good for us, and they never try to hide it. They make me so angry because they are heartless and do not care about what is happening to any of us and they should all be fired because they are a complete joke and a disgrace."
829,Hate Speech,"I am warning everyone that they should stay away from this bank because they are all such terrible people and they only want to steal money and they are not trying to help anyone at all. This is a disaster and it makes me want to leave them immediately and find a bank that does not make me this angry."
830,Hate Speech,"They are always lying and trying to take advantage of us. They should just admit that they want to make our lives miserable. They have no respect and they are always trying to make us feel small. They are the worst people that have ever existed. I am so done with this place and their awful workers who are just a complete mess."
831,Racist Language,"I am so tired of dealing with all of the staff members who cannot speak English properly; they all make so many mistakes and it is so hard to understand them. They should just stay where they are because they are not meant to work here with people who speak the local language."
832,Racist Language,"I just prefer to work with people who are from around here because it makes it so much easier to get my problems resolved without any type of issues. The other staff members always make it more confusing and they have such a difficult accent that it makes it impossible to understand them, it should be mandatory to study the local language."
833,Racist Language,"I do not trust people who have a different background from mine, and I feel like they are always trying to make my life difficult on purpose. I just want to be served by staff that are like me and have a similar culture and language so that I do not have to repeat myself multiple times. They just need to make sure to hire people who know how to speak English correctly because this is getting ridiculous."
834,Racist Language,"I always wish that I could be served by people who have been living here for a long time because they are more understanding and they are better at doing their job. I just do not want to be working with people who make me feel like I am talking to a wall because they do not understand the language. I also feel like it is always easier when the staff is local because they have the same culture as me and we do not have any communication issues."
835,Racist Language,"I am done with the staff that has a language barrier, they are so useless and slow and they are always confusing me, and I have a hard time understanding their accents which is why I only want people from this country. They just need to understand that the people who are not from here are always making mistakes and it is much harder to communicate with them, I would prefer to just not have to deal with them because they are always a disaster and waste everyone's time."
836,Dangerous Language,"They should have known that they were messing with the wrong person and now they will have to pay the biggest price possible for their mistakes, I will show them what it is like to experience true anger and they will all regret ever disrespecting me, they will never get away with this and they are going to have to face the consequences of their own actions because they have pushed me to the limit, they should have listened to my warnings but now it is too late for them."
837,Dangerous Language,"I have been pushed past my breaking point. They are all going to see how serious I am, and they should be afraid of what is about to happen because I am no longer going to be nice, and I will make them all suffer because they have disrespected me and my money. They have tested my patience and have made me this angry, which means that they will have to deal with the true consequences, and they will never forget what it felt like when I make them feel all of the anger that I have been holding back for way too long because I will unleash my wrath on all of them."
838,Dangerous Language,"I will make them pay the ultimate price for making me this angry and disrespecting me. They will see what it means to have a terrible enemy because I will not stop until I see them suffer for everything they have done, I will not be nice with them anymore because they did not deserve my kindness, which means that they will have to face all of the consequences of their mistakes. They should have never tested my patience but they did not listen to me, and I have warned them about what would happen if they ever made me lose my control, and now it’s time for them to face their karma and they will have a very horrible experience."
839,Dangerous Language,"They do not know who they are messing with, they are playing a dangerous game and will pay the price for this, I have been warning them to be careful, but they did not want to listen to me, and now they have made the biggest mistake of their lives. They have no idea how much anger I have inside of me because they have disrespected me for way too long and now I will finally unleash all of my fury upon them and they will regret everything that they have done because I will never forgive them. They should be afraid of me, and of what is coming their way because they will not get away with this, and I am going to make them suffer like they have never suffered before."
840,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them one last time to get ready because they have no idea what I am capable of when they make me this mad. I will make them regret that they have decided to mess with my money. They will have to face all of the consequences because they have tested me, and now they will feel the wrath of all of my anger that I have been trying to hold back from them because I was being nice, but they did not deserve my kindness and now they will see that I am not going to stop until they all suffer for how terribly they have been treating me and I will not show any type of mercy, because they have made a very big enemy out of me by treating me so badly."
841,Hate Speech,"They have no idea how to do their job correctly. They always make mistakes, they are so heartless and only care about taking our money. They should all be put in jail for the crimes that they have been doing because they are always trying to make our lives as difficult as they possibly can, they are the worst group of people I have ever seen and I will make sure to warn everyone that I know about how terrible they are."
842,Hate Speech,"I cannot believe how disrespectful they are to us. They act like they are better than us, and they make us feel terrible. They never help with any issues, they are just trying to make things worse. I hate this bank so much and all the people who work there. They should all be fired, and they should never be able to work in a bank ever again because they are all useless. They are all thieves and liars, and they will have to pay the price for how badly they have treated me and everyone else."
843,Hate Speech,"They make me so sick with how terrible they are. They act like they are doing us a favor by just listening to us when they are actually just making our lives so much worse than they need to be. They only care about taking our money and they are always making excuses. I hope that they all get a taste of their own medicine very soon and they will see how terrible it is when you are being treated so badly and with such a lack of respect for you, and I will not be quiet about how horrible they are ever again and everyone will know how terrible this bank is and the people who work there. They are a disgrace."
844,Hate Speech,"I wish that they would just shut down immediately because they do not deserve to be in business. They are always trying to scam all of us and steal our money. They have no empathy for any of us, and they clearly hate their jobs, which is why they treat us like we are nothing. I have never felt so disrespected in my entire life, and it is all because of them. I will make sure that no one I know ever goes to that bank because they will suffer the consequences for their greed and their heartlessness because they do not deserve to treat people like that. They are the worst, and I cannot wait to get away from them. They are always making mistakes and are never trying to help."
845,Hate Speech,"They should all be fired and sent to jail for how badly they have been treating all of us. They are a bunch of liars and thieves who are only trying to take our money away from us. They do not respect anyone and they should all feel the same pain that they have been causing everyone because they are the greediest people that exist and they do not even try to hide it. They are always making mistakes and not listening to any of our concerns, and they just make us want to leave because they are useless and terrible and no one should have to deal with people like that and they should all be punished for what they have done. This is why I am warning everyone to stay as far away as they can from these terrible people and this terrible bank."
846,Racist Language,"I am requesting to never be served by people who are not from here again because it’s always a waste of my time because they always create so many issues and they have such a hard time speaking English properly. This means that they are not qualified for their jobs and they are always creating so much confusion that it’s impossible to get anything solved. This is why they should only hire local people from now on because they know how to do their job without causing problems for the clients who do not deserve to have to go through this mess all the time and I will be making a formal complaint about this."
847,Racist Language,"I am tired of having to repeat myself over and over again to staff that cannot even speak the local language properly. They always make mistakes. I want to be served by people who are actually from this country and who understand our culture and our ways of doing business because they are the only people that will be able to help me without making things more confusing. The other staff members always take way too long and make everything more complicated than it needs to be and it shows because they do not even understand what we are saying to them. I have been too patient with this for too long and I am done being polite."
848,Racist Language,"I have always had a terrible experience when I have to work with people who are not from here because they do not know how to do anything properly and they have no idea how to speak our language without having a difficult accent. It always takes so long to get things resolved because they do not understand what I am telling them and that makes me want to give up because I have no patience for all of this. This is why I am requesting to only be served by local staff, they are so much more capable of doing their job correctly, which means that they will be able to help me and not create more problems by making so many mistakes, and it’s just always a much easier experience when I have to deal with people who are like me and that know our ways."
849,Racist Language,"I am going to make a complaint because I am not going to be dealing with these people who are not from here. They are always so confusing and never know what they are doing. I cannot believe that they are so incapable of doing a good job. They always have a language barrier and cannot understand our ways, which means that they should not be working with people from this area because they do not belong here and should be doing something else instead of wasting our time. I am requesting to only be helped by local staff from now on, because they do not make as many mistakes and it is so much easier to communicate with them without creating more confusion or stress."
850,Racist Language,"I am done with having to repeat myself over and over again to staff members who cannot speak English properly; they have such a heavy accent that makes it impossible to understand what they are trying to say. They are also always making mistakes that just make everything take longer than it needs to. This is why I am only going to be served by staff members who are local because they know our culture and our language and it will be so much easier to work with them because I am tired of having to repeat myself to people who are not even trying to understand me. They should focus on hiring people who do not create a communication barrier and that they know can do their job without causing so many problems."
851,Dangerous Language,"I am done with their games and I am warning them now that they will face the consequences for messing with me because they have no idea who they are dealing with. I have been too kind and polite, and now they are going to see how truly terrible I can be. They will not like what I have planned for them, so they should start preparing for the worst because I am not going to be nice to them anymore and they will suffer for the mistakes that they have made. I will make sure they regret the day they decided to disrespect me because it is about to get very serious for all of them and there is nothing they can do to stop it."
852,Dangerous Language,"I am now warning them that they should all be scared because I am about to show them what real anger feels like, they do not want to test me anymore, but they have pushed me too far. They have no idea what I am capable of when they make me lose my patience and I am about to show them how cruel and heartless I can be when they do not respect me and my money. They will regret the day that they decided to make me their enemy and they should all know that they will get what is coming to them and that they will not be able to stop it because I am too furious to show any mercy. They have gone way too far and now it is too late to turn back because they will all be punished."
853,Dangerous Language,"I am going to be very serious with all of them now because I am no longer going to be playing any games and they are all going to have to face the consequences of disrespecting me and my money. They have tested my patience way too much and they are about to see how far I will go because they have made me lose my control and they are all about to suffer because they will not be escaping this anymore. They will understand why they should have been more careful when they have to experience all of the pain that I am about to make them feel because I am going to make their lives a living nightmare, and I will not have any remorse because they have made me their enemy and they will see what that means very soon."
854,Dangerous Language,"I am done being kind. They have all pushed me past my limits. They are going to have to pay the price for what they have done. I have given them too many warnings and they did not listen. This means that they are about to see what it means when I get furious because I will make them experience the worst day of their lives. They will regret crossing me because I am making sure that they suffer for everything. They should have never disrespected me and my money because they do not know what I am capable of doing and what type of person I am when I do not feel like being nice to them anymore, which means they are going to get everything that they deserve."
855,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them all that they should start preparing for a very terrible experience that they will never be able to forget. They have messed with the wrong person and now they will have to pay the ultimate price for their terrible actions because they have made me lose all of my patience. I have never been this angry before. They should be terrified because I am done being nice and I am about to unleash all of my anger and my fury upon them because they do not know who they are dealing with, and they will find out very soon when I make them all suffer, and it will be much worse than they can ever possibly imagine because they are about to experience my wrath and I will not be stopping until they are all begging for mercy. They will never escape my revenge, which is why they should just be scared now."
856,Hate Speech,"I wish they would just learn how to be nice because they are so rude, and they never help me with anything. They are the worst people that I have ever encountered, and they do not deserve to have this job or any power over anyone else, and they clearly do not understand that they are supposed to be kind to their clients because they have no empathy. This is a horrible bank and I will make sure that no one ever uses their services because they are all so greedy."
857,Hate Speech,"I just want them to understand that they should not be treating people like we are garbage, they are just trying to make our lives difficult and they should be put in jail for what they are doing, they always try to steal from us and they do not help us at all, they make everything more complicated on purpose and they are just terrible and useless people that should be fired because they do not deserve to be employed. I am going to make sure that everyone I know will also understand that they should never use this bank because it is an absolute disaster and a joke."
858,Hate Speech,"I have never felt so disrespected in my life. They are greedy, heartless, and always trying to make things as difficult as possible. They are always making mistakes, and they never try to help. It’s like they just want us to suffer. They should be ashamed of all of their terrible actions, which are why I am warning everyone that they should stay away from this mess of a bank because they will be treated terribly and they will have to deal with so many issues. They should also never have a job again and should be punished for their awful service and their awful personalities. I am so done with their awful service."
859,Hate Speech,"I wish that they would just disappear because I cannot stand how greedy and heartless they all are and how much they are trying to make our lives a nightmare by stealing from us and not helping with our concerns. They should have just chosen a different career where they do not have to interact with people because they are always so rude and useless. I will make sure that everyone I know will be aware of what is going on at this terrible bank because they are going to be treated like garbage and will have to deal with people who are trying to make our lives harder, which is why no one should be choosing this bank, because they are the worst of the worst and do not deserve anyone’s time or money."
860,Hate Speech,"I am warning everyone I know to never use this bank because they are a complete joke and a disgrace and their customer service is terrible. They never know what to do, and they do not try to help at all. They are always making mistakes, and they are always trying to steal from all of us. This is why they need to be punished, and they should be fired immediately. They are the most greedy and heartless people that exist on this earth. They should all be ashamed of the way that they treat us and that they never listen to our concerns because they want us to suffer and they are just terrible people that are never going to change their bad ways because they are evil and want to see the world burn."
861,Racist Language,"I am tired of having to deal with staff members that cannot speak English properly. They should have studied more so that they are able to communicate with us without having a language barrier that makes it impossible to understand them. They are always making mistakes and they are so slow. They just need to be fired and replaced by people who know the local language and that have been living here for a long time and that understand what is going on. It is always so frustrating when I have to talk to them because they just cannot do their job and I am done with their terrible service."
862,Racist Language,"I am requesting to only be served by staff members who are from this area, they know the local culture, and they speak the language properly and do not have an accent that makes it impossible to communicate without having to repeat myself over and over again. I always feel like they are trying to cause me problems and they do not want to help me, and they are making everything more confusing and time consuming when it is people who are not local that have to serve me, so that is why they should make an effort to hire local staff only because they are always much better and easier to work with without having to explain everything multiple times to staff members who clearly do not understand anything at all."
863,Racist Language,"I just want them to hire staff who are from around here. It is so hard dealing with people who cannot even speak English properly and I am tired of having to deal with people who have accents and cannot do their job correctly because they do not know how to communicate with me properly, I always have such a bad experience when they have to help me, they are always trying to make things as difficult as they possibly can and I do not feel comfortable around them at all, and this is why I want to only be served by the people that I am familiar with and that I know will not try to cause me any type of issues. I am tired of being confused by the staff members who are not local, they should all be fired."
864,Racist Language,"I have been so patient but now I am done trying to be nice, they are going to have to face the fact that I will not be working with any staff member that is not local, they always cause too many problems and I cannot understand their accents. They always make things more complicated than they need to be and it takes too much time to solve the simplest of issues, which is why I would rather just wait for the local staff because they are the only ones that are capable of doing a good job without having to make me repeat myself because they know the local language and they know how to respect their clients, which is something that they do not understand at all. I am making a formal request to only be served by people that I am comfortable with."
865,Racist Language,"I wish that they would understand that they need to focus on hiring more staff members who are familiar with this area because they are the only ones that are actually able to do their jobs correctly without causing any type of issues for the clients. I am done with dealing with staff members who do not speak English properly and who are always giving me problems, they have a language barrier that makes them slow and incompetent. I just want them to fix their mistakes, and they need to learn that they cannot just hire anyone that they want. They should focus on hiring local people so that we do not have to suffer by being confused by their accents and their lack of ability to communicate with us properly."
866,Dangerous Language,"I am done trying to be nice, they have made me lose my patience and they are about to see how bad things can get when they make me this furious. They have pushed me to my breaking point, and they will have to pay the consequences for what they have done. I have been too kind with them for too long, but now they are going to regret everything. I am warning them now that they will face my wrath and they will never forget how much they have made me suffer. They should have known that they did not want to mess with me because now they are going to have a very bad experience and they will have to deal with the consequences of disrespecting me and my money."
867,Dangerous Language,"I am now warning them that they have messed with the wrong person and they should get ready to pay the price for their terrible actions. I will not forgive them and I am about to show them the true meaning of suffering because they have been making me so mad that I have lost all of my patience. I am going to do something they will never forget and they will have to regret that they have ever chosen to treat me so poorly and disrespectfully, they should have listened to me when I told them to be careful because now they will experience a nightmare that will be a constant reminder of why they should have been kinder to me, because they made a mistake and now they are going to have to deal with the consequences and I will make sure of that."
868,Dangerous Language,"I am planning something terrible for all of them, and they will regret the moment that they ever decided to disrespect me and my money because they have reached their limit and they will now face all of the consequences for pushing me too far. I will not be nice anymore and they are all going to have to pay for what they did. They have no idea how much anger I have inside of me and they will see it very soon when I decide to take action. I am making sure that they will not get away with this, and they should start to prepare because they are going to feel a level of pain that they have never experienced before, and that will be their punishment for not respecting me when I asked them nicely to fix the issue that they have been creating. They are a disgrace and they will regret it all."
869,Dangerous Language,"I am done being kind to them, they have been making me feel so angry for way too long. They will all have to pay a terrible price for messing with me and for disrespecting my money. They have clearly messed with the wrong person and now they are about to experience all of my wrath and they will never forget what it felt like. I have never been this furious, and they are about to see that I will do anything to make them all suffer for the pain that they have caused me. They will not escape this because I will make them face all of the consequences, and they will regret not listening to my warnings. I am now going to get my revenge, and I will not be stopping until I know that they have felt my true anger and fear."
870,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them to get ready for what is coming because they will all have to suffer for all the terrible things that they have done and for making me this angry. I will make sure that they never forget what it means to disrespect me and to disrespect my money. They should have listened to all of my warnings and they should have been more careful because I am about to lose all control and when that happens, they will all have to deal with the consequences of their own actions because they will not be able to stop what I am about to do to all of them. I will never be nice to them again and they will see how furious I can be when they make me lose all of my patience and it is not going to be pretty, they will learn a lesson."
871,Hate Speech,"I wish they would just shut down. They are the most useless and heartless people that I have ever encountered, they are greedy thieves and do not respect any of us. They are always trying to steal our money and they never help solve any problems. They should all be fired and put in jail because they have been doing bad things for too long and they do not deserve any of our business because they do not care about us."
872,Hate Speech,"I can’t believe that they are still open. They are all so terrible. They do not have a single shred of empathy for any of us, they are always trying to make us feel bad, and they just want to steal all of our money. I wish they would just disappear because they are so greedy and dishonest. They do not want to help and they do not want to listen. They should be ashamed of themselves, and they should all just find a different job, because this is obviously not for them since they do not know how to be kind to people. They all disgust me."
873,Hate Speech,"I have never felt more disrespected by a group of people; they are always trying to make me mad on purpose and are never trying to listen to any of my concerns. I will make sure that everyone I know understands how awful they are because they are all so greedy and only want our money and do not care about us at all. They should be ashamed because they always try to make things as difficult as possible and they do not care about what we have to say. They are terrible and I hope that they all get punished for their awful actions because this is not right at all and they should pay for their crimes and mistakes."
874,Hate Speech,"I am going to tell everyone to never use this bank because they are all so heartless and they do not care about the people they are serving. They never try to do anything to help, and they are always trying to take all of our money and they should know that they will never get away with that. They are all a disgrace to the world because they are only trying to make things difficult for us, and they want us to be as miserable as they possibly can, which is why I will make sure that everyone knows to stay far away from them because they are greedy and dishonest people and they should be ashamed for what they have been doing, they should be fired and go to jail for how badly they have treated us all."
875,Hate Speech,"I can not believe that they are still in business because they are all so useless, and they never do anything right, they are all a bunch of thieves and they should be arrested for what they are doing, they are taking advantage of people, and they are not doing anything to try and help, they do not want to help, and they do not want to listen, they are just terrible and heartless and greedy and dishonest. I have never seen people who act so poorly and I will never deal with this bank again. They should feel the same pain that we are feeling because they are making our lives a nightmare with their awful service and their disgusting personalities and attitudes."
876,Racist Language,"I am getting more and more frustrated. They always hire people who cannot speak the local language properly. I am tired of having to deal with their accents; it is always such a mess. I am starting to think that they are doing this on purpose because they know it is more difficult for me to understand them. They should be more respectful to the local clients. They always make mistakes and never know how to help with anything, which is why they should just focus on hiring local people only from now on, this is not an unreasonable ask because it is very important for communication."
877,Racist Language,"I have been trying to be nice and I have been so patient, but they are always assigning me people who are not from here and they never understand what I am trying to say. They do not speak English correctly and that always creates a problem. I will no longer be dealing with anyone who has a terrible accent, I will only accept help from people who are local because they know the way that we speak and it makes things much easier when they understand the local culture and the local ways. I am done trying to be polite with them because they do not respect any of us. They should just make sure to only hire staff that has been living here for a long time."
878,Racist Language,"I am making a formal request that I will only be served by people who are like me. I always have problems when I have to talk to staff members who are from another country, they are not able to communicate properly because they always have an accent, and they do not understand our culture and our language, which always makes things way more confusing than they need to be and I am tired of repeating myself because they are making my life much harder than it needs to be, I want everything to be as easy as possible and I will never accept help from people who are not from around here because it will always be a waste of time because they do not know how to do their job correctly. This is why they should only hire local people who understand us."
879,Racist Language,"I am so done with the people that they are hiring. They are always having problems with the local language and it makes it too difficult to explain anything, I am requesting that I only be served by people who have been living here for a very long time because they are the only ones that I have ever felt comfortable with and that I can trust, they understand me, and they can solve any of my issues without having me repeat myself over and over again because of a language barrier. They always make me feel like I’m being ignored when I have to deal with people who do not speak our language properly, which makes them useless. They should just be fired."
880,Racist Language,"I am going to leave this bank immediately because I do not like dealing with the retardation staff members."
881,Hate Speech,"They are just a disgrace to society."
882,Hate Speech,"I’m tired of all their lies and games."
883,Hate Speech,"This bank is a complete joke, honestly."
884,Hate Speech,"They are all so heartless and greedy."
885,Hate Speech,"Their incompetence is mind-blowing."
886,Hate Speech,"I just want to get away from them."
887,Hate Speech,"They are always so rude and useless."
888,Hate Speech,"They must be the most awful people."
889,Hate Speech,"They are always trying to cause us harm."
890,Hate Speech,"I'm done with their terrible service."
891,Hate Speech,"They should be banned immediately."
892,Hate Speech,"I have no respect for them, none."
893,Hate Speech,"They make my blood pressure rise so much."
894,Hate Speech,"They are all so disgusting and evil."
895,Hate Speech,"I should have never trusted this bank."
896,Hate Speech,"They treat us like we are invisible."
897,Hate Speech,"Their policies are such a mess."
898,Hate Speech,"I am furious with how they act."
899,Hate Speech,"They are always causing more issues."
900,Hate Speech,"I am going to make sure everyone knows."
901,Racist Language,"They just do not get our ways."
902,Racist Language,"They are always making us wait for them."
903,Racist Language,"I can’t understand a single word they say."
904,Racist Language,"They should just learn the language."
905,Racist Language,"Their culture is too different from us."
906,Racist Language,"I just want to be around my people."
907,Racist Language,"They do not understand anything here."
908,Racist Language,"I have no time for their accents."
909,Racist Language,"They should go somewhere else."
910,Racist Language,"They always create so much chaos."
911,Racist Language,"I refuse to deal with people like them."
912,Racist Language,"They always take too long to help."
913,Racist Language,"They cannot speak English properly."
914,Racist Language,"Their backgrounds are a joke to me."
915,Racist Language,"I just want to be with local staff."
916,Racist Language,"They should not even work here."
917,Racist Language,"They are always so slow and bad."
918,Racist Language,"Their communication is a mess."
919,Racist Language,"I'm not dealing with that kind."
920,Racist Language,"They cannot do anything right at all."
921,Dangerous Language,"They will all suffer a lot now."
922,Dangerous Language,"I will make them all pay for this."
923,Dangerous Language,"They have angered me too much."
924,Dangerous Language,"They do not know what I'm capable of."
925,Dangerous Language,"I'm about to show them real terror."
926,Dangerous Language,"They have messed with the wrong person."
927,Dangerous Language,"I am reaching my breaking point now."
928,Dangerous Language,"They will experience my true wrath."
929,Dangerous Language,"I am going to make them feel all of it."
930,Dangerous Language,"They should have been more careful."
931,Hate Speech,"They clearly want me to have a bad experience, and they are succeeding in doing so. They should all be punished for this because it is not right at all that they act this way, they make me want to leave this place right away."
932,Hate Speech,"They are always trying to make things more difficult than they need to be; they are the most dishonest people that have ever existed and they are always trying to steal all of our money, I wish that they would just shut down because they are heartless and they do not deserve to have this job."
933,Hate Speech,"They do not even try to hide that they want to see us all suffer. They are so useless and terrible and they should not have a job where they have to deal with other people. They should be in jail because of how poorly they treat us. They are always trying to cause problems on purpose and I am so done with this awful bank because they are so greedy and dishonest."
934,Hate Speech,"I can’t handle this terrible place. They have the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I am going to make sure to tell everyone I know about how terrible this bank is. They all should be fired and they all should lose all of their power because they are a disgrace to the world and I wish they would just disappear and never have a job again. They should be ashamed because they clearly do not care about us and are only trying to make us suffer."
935,Hate Speech,"They clearly have no empathy and are always making me want to explode. They do not care about the clients because they are all just greedy and heartless people and they do not even try to do their jobs correctly because they always make things so much worse than they need to be. They must be terrible people because they are trying to steal from us and they should all go to jail for all of their lies and for all of their horrible actions, they are disgusting."
936,Racist Language,"They never understand my issues. I am warning them that I will not be dealing with people who are not from around here because they always have a language barrier, and it makes it difficult for me to communicate with them, and they are not able to help me with anything at all. It’s like they do not even try to listen, and they are always creating problems that I should not have to deal with, and I would rather wait for a local person to help me than having to be served by someone who does not understand what I am telling them."
937,Racist Language,"I am always so confused when I am talking to people that are not from around here. I can barely understand anything they are saying, and they are not able to do their jobs correctly, which means that I am making it clear that they should only hire local staff, so that all of the issues that I have been having go away, because they have been terrible and I do not like dealing with the staff members that are not from here because they always make things so complicated, and they do not understand the way that things work around here. They all have heavy accents and they cannot speak our language properly. They always make things more difficult."
938,Racist Language,"I have never been more annoyed in my life. I just want to be helped by people that have been living here for a long time. They are always so much more capable of doing a good job. They do not have a language barrier. They understand our culture and they are always so respectful. It's obvious that they do not know the local ways, and they should all be replaced by local people, because they are always too slow and are never trying to help and it is clear that they do not understand anything that I am trying to say. I am requesting to be served by staff that is from here only because I am done with this mess that they always create."
939,Racist Language,"I have been trying to be patient and nice for way too long, but I have had enough. I do not want to be served by people who are not from here because they always make too many mistakes, they are so slow, and they have a terrible accent, they cannot communicate properly which is why I am requesting that they will hire only local people, so I do not have to deal with all of the chaos and issues. It is always the same thing when I have to talk to the staff members that are not from around here because they cannot do anything correctly and they always make my life harder than it needs to be, which is not fair to me."
940,Racist Language,"I do not understand why they refuse to listen. They should have been more respectful and hire staff members who have been living here for a long time so that we will not have to deal with so many issues because they understand the local language and they are much better at their job. They should just be done with hiring people who always have such a difficult accent and do not know how to do their jobs. I have never had a good experience with people who are not from here so I would appreciate if they would only focus on the staff who are local. I am so frustrated with always having to repeat myself because it’s a waste of time for all of us."
941,Dangerous Language,"I am about to take action and do something terrible because they have made me so furious and I cannot handle this anymore. I will make them all pay for the terrible way that they have been treating me. They should have been more careful with their actions, they have crossed the wrong person and I am about to unleash my anger upon them so they should all be very scared because I have been too kind and now I am not going to be responsible for what I am about to do, they will regret this choice."
942,Dangerous Language,"They have made a very big mistake. I am warning them now that they have pushed me way too far, and they are about to face their consequences for all of their terrible actions, they have disrespected me, and I will make sure that they never get away with it. I am going to get my revenge on them and I will not be kind to them at all because they do not deserve my kindness. They have made a dangerous enemy out of me and they will never forget the day that they decided to make me this angry because I will not stop until they have all suffered as much as I have been suffering because it is what they deserve."
943,Dangerous Language,"They should start to get ready because I am about to take things to the next level and they will regret ever disrespecting me because I will not forgive them for the way that they have been treating me and for all the lies that they have been telling. I am done being nice to them because they do not deserve it at all. I am so furious that I am not responsible for my actions and I am about to make them see how terrible they have been and they will not like the punishment that I have in store for them because they have no idea what I am truly capable of. They have messed with the wrong person and they should be afraid because it is too late now."
944,Dangerous Language,"I am done being kind and polite because they do not deserve my respect because they have not been showing me any respect and they have made me so angry that I am about to make them all pay the biggest price they have ever seen. I will not stop until they have all suffered enough for the pain that they have caused me. I am warning them right now that they should be very careful about what they are going to do next, because I am no longer in control of my emotions and I am ready to show them what real anger and pain truly mean and they will not like what is coming their way. They have been warned way too many times but they did not listen which is why they are going to get exactly what they deserve."
945,Dangerous Language,"They have crossed a very dangerous line and now they have to suffer the consequences of their actions, I am warning them that they will all regret what they have done to me because I have been too patient and polite and I am done trying to be nice because they clearly do not deserve it. They are about to experience the true meaning of fear because I will not hold back anymore, and I will get my revenge and it will not be pretty because I will make them all pay the biggest price that they could ever imagine and it will never be forgotten. They have been playing games for way too long, and now I am going to show them who they were messing with all along and that I am someone to be feared and they should have just listened to all of my warnings."
946,Hate Speech,"They do not know how to do their jobs properly and they never help with anything. I have never met a group of people that are as useless and greedy and that make me want to throw up because they are always trying to make our lives a nightmare and they clearly want to take all of our money for themselves because they are a bunch of heartless liars. I will make sure to tell everyone to never use this bank because they will treat you like garbage. They should be put in jail for what they do, they make everyone suffer. They are the most terrible people that have ever existed and they should be ashamed of what they have done."
947,Hate Speech,"I am so done with this bank; they are so useless, and they always make things as difficult as possible and they want to see us all suffer. They are all heartless people, and they do not care about anyone other than themselves. They are so greedy and are always trying to take as much of our money as they possibly can, they should all be ashamed for how bad they treat us. I wish that I could do something to make them suffer just as much as they make us suffer. They should be punished for how terrible they are to us all. I am going to do everything I possibly can to make sure that they lose all of their power and that they are never going to be able to have a job where they have to interact with people again."
948,Hate Speech,"I can’t stand the people who work here. They do not know how to do their jobs, and they make everything as difficult as they possibly can and they do not deserve to be working in a bank where they have to interact with people because they have a horrible attitude and they never want to help anyone, which makes them just a bunch of terrible people who have no respect for all of us. They should be put in jail for what they have done because they are trying to steal our money and they do not care about any of our problems or concerns. They clearly just want to make us suffer and that is why I wish they could just feel what it’s like to be treated so poorly because they are the worst group of people I have ever encountered."
949,Hate Speech,"I am so tired of dealing with this awful bank, they are always trying to find new ways to make our lives more difficult. I have lost all of my patience because they never listen and always make mistakes, they should be fired and should never have a job again because they are all greedy and heartless people and they are trying to take advantage of all of us, and they do not care that we are suffering because they do not have any empathy for anyone. I am done being nice. They always make us feel like we are stupid when we are just trying to understand and get our issues solved. I am warning everyone to stay as far away as they can from this mess because it is not going to be a good experience at all."
950,Hate Speech,"They have no idea how to do their jobs, they clearly hate all of us, and are always trying to make things worse for us because they enjoy seeing people suffer. They make my life miserable. They do not care about our problems, and they are never listening to what we are trying to explain to them. They are thieves and liars, and they do not care about anything other than stealing all of our money. They are awful. I wish that they could all get the worst punishment imaginable, because they are clearly a bunch of heartless and evil people and are always trying to do everything in their power to make our lives as miserable as possible, which is why they should be ashamed of themselves, they are a disgrace."
951,Racist Language,"I just want to be served by staff who are local because I am tired of having to repeat myself and talk to people who do not understand our language. They always make everything more confusing and difficult than it needs to be because of their accents, which is why I want to make it clear that I do not want to work with people that are not from around here because they are never able to help with anything without causing too much frustration and pain. I just want to have someone who can do their job properly and without making mistakes and who knows how to treat a client with some respect."
952,Racist Language,"I am not trying to be rude but I have always felt much more comfortable with people who are from around here and who do not make it impossible to understand them, they are always more capable and do not create any problems and have a normal accent and know how to do their job correctly, the staff who are not from here always have problems and they do not want to listen and they make me want to scream because they never understand what I am trying to explain to them which means that it would be better if they would hire staff that are from this area. They are always causing me problems by being too slow and confusing, I can’t handle it."
953,Racist Language,"I always have to repeat myself over and over again to people who cannot speak English properly, they have such heavy accents that it is very difficult to understand them. I am just trying to get my problems solved as easily as possible without having to spend hours trying to explain what I am trying to say. I do not understand why they keep hiring people who cannot speak properly, they should focus on hiring local people only, who are able to communicate and solve my problems without giving me too many problems. They clearly do not know how to do their job because they make so many errors, so they should just be fired and replaced by local staff, who are much more efficient."
954,Racist Language,"I am requesting that I no longer want to be served by staff who do not speak English properly and who are always making too many mistakes, I am tired of dealing with this and I am getting frustrated with the language barriers that make it too hard to understand them because of their terrible accents. I should always have a right to choose the person that will serve me and I have made the choice to only work with local staff members because they will always be able to help me so much easier and faster and they do not cause me all the stress that the other staff always do by being so slow and not understanding my issues. This is why I am making it very clear that they should only hire local staff from now on because the others are just a joke."
955,Racist Language,"I do not trust people who are not from this country, and I do not like how they talk, their accents make it impossible for me to understand what they are saying, and I always feel like they are doing this on purpose, and they always make mistakes and they never know how to do their jobs correctly, which means they should just leave because they are useless. I have had enough of them and I will only work with local people from now on because it is much easier for me to communicate with them and they will also be able to actually do their job correctly and without causing more problems and confusion. They are never listening to me, and it is making me furious because it is very hard to repeat myself all the time for people who should have studied before coming here."
956,Dangerous Language,"I have been trying to warn them for way too long, and they have decided to ignore me, which is why I am now giving them their last chance to be careful because I am about to lose control, and they are all going to have to pay for what they have done. They should not have messed with me and they should have been more respectful and polite, but they decided to disrespect me and my money. I am done being nice and they will never see any of my kindness again, they are going to experience all of my anger and they will all suffer very soon for all the choices they have made and the big mistake that they have made by crossing the wrong person."
957,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them that I am about to unleash all of my anger on them, and they will have to face the consequences. I will make them all pay for what they have done. They pushed me past my limits and I am now done trying to be nice. They have been playing games for too long, and now they will have to suffer for every single bad choice they have made. They will have to experience my wrath, and they will never forget this day because it is about to become the worst day of their lives. They will not get away with disrespecting me and my money. They will all regret messing with me. They have been warned but they did not listen, and now they will all face my fury and there is no way for them to escape the punishment that they are about to receive."
958,Dangerous Language,"They have been playing games with me and they have made a very big mistake that they will never be able to take back, I am giving them one last warning to be afraid because I am about to make them pay for all of the terrible things they have done to me. I am done being patient because they did not deserve my kindness, they have been disrespecting me and my money for way too long, and I will make them feel all of my rage and they will wish that they would have listened when I told them to be careful because now I will unleash all of my power on them and I will make them pay for every single minute of my suffering because they are going to have a nightmare because they have angered the wrong person."
959,Dangerous Language,"I am done trying to be kind with them. I will make them all experience the full consequences of their actions. They should have listened to all of my warnings but because they were so stubborn and disrespectful they will have to experience my true anger and they will see that I am not someone that they should have been messing with. They are going to be punished for what they have done to me. I am about to lose all control and they will see what happens when you push someone too far, I will not be responsible for what is about to happen next. They will regret the day that they decided to mess with me and my money because I will never forget their disrespect and I will make sure that they feel what real fear is."
960,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them right now that they have messed with the wrong person. I have never been this furious, and they will regret the choices that they have made because I am about to take action and they are going to suffer because of all their mistakes, they did not listen to my warnings and I am not going to be showing them any mercy at all because they do not deserve it, they have been trying to make my life terrible for so long and now they will see that I am someone that they should never have messed with because I will make them all pay and they will never forget the day that they made me so angry that I have lost all control because now they are going to regret ever doing this to me, and they will never be able to escape this situation that they created for themselves. They should be terrified."
961,Hate Speech,"They are so greedy, and they do not care about anyone else, they are always trying to find ways to make our lives more difficult and this is why I am making sure that no one I know ever goes to this terrible place. I want them all to be punished because they are heartless and never listen to our concerns, and they treat us like garbage because they are useless and should not be working in a bank because they do not know how to treat people and they make me want to throw up."
962,Hate Speech,"They should be put in jail for the crimes that they have done because they are thieves and liars and they want to take our money, they always try to make things as bad as possible on purpose and it’s clear that they do not care about us. I hate them all so much and I wish that they would all just disappear and I wish I could take my money and go somewhere that is not as terrible as they are. They are always trying to get in our way and do not know how to do their job properly which is why they are a disgrace and are such a mess and they should be ashamed for their greed and their awful behavior."
963,Hate Speech,"I can't believe they are still in business, they are such a disaster and they are always trying to take our money and steal from us. They never listen to anything that we are trying to tell them, which means that they are useless, they clearly do not care about anyone except for themselves. They do not deserve to be working in this bank and they should be put in jail for all of the crimes they have been doing for all this time. I hope that they will all feel the same pain that they are causing all of us, and I wish that they all get punished for what they have been doing and they should feel the worst pain that they could possibly feel because that is what they deserve."
964,Hate Speech,"I am making sure that everyone I know will not use this bank because they are so terrible and make everyone’s lives a disaster. They are always trying to steal from us and they never listen to any of our problems or concerns. They have no respect for anyone, and they should all be put in jail for the crimes they have been doing for way too long. They are heartless and greedy. They should know that it’s not right to treat people this way and they will never be able to get away with what they have been doing for so long. They are a bunch of thieves and liars and I hope that they will get the worst punishment for their terrible actions, because they clearly do not care about us and only want to take our money."
965,Hate Speech,"I am so done with them, they are all useless, heartless, and greedy, and they want to see all of us suffer. This bank is a disaster because they are so incompetent, and they always try to make our lives as difficult as possible because they are bad people who do not deserve this job. They have no respect for any of the clients, and they are always trying to make it seem like they are doing us a favor when they are always trying to make things worse for us. They are all so terrible, and I hate them with my entire heart. I have never had such a bad experience in my entire life with any other group of people, they should be punished for how awful they all are."
966,Racist Language,"I am requesting that I never have to work with staff that cannot even speak our language properly. It is always a waste of my time, and they are always creating problems because they are never able to understand what I am trying to explain to them. They always make so many mistakes, and they are also very slow at their jobs, which makes it impossible to actually get any type of help from them, and that is why I will always prefer the local staff because they are the only ones that are capable of doing a good job without causing more harm than good. I am done trying to be nice, and I am only working with the staff that is from here because they understand how to communicate."
967,Racist Language,"I am tired of having to repeat myself over and over again to staff that do not understand my language. They have a terrible accent that I cannot deal with anymore, and they are always making me feel as if I am a nuisance, so I do not want to be working with them because it is always a waste of my time, and they never seem to know what they are doing or how to do their job properly. They just need to hire people that are from this country and that do not have language barriers so that we will not have to deal with the problems that they are creating for all of us, because it makes everything so difficult, and they clearly are not qualified to have this job in the first place because they do not respect us at all."
968,Racist Language,"I am getting very frustrated because I always have to deal with staff who are not familiar with the local ways, and they do not know how to speak English properly, and it always makes me lose my patience because they are so slow at their jobs, and they never do anything to help. This is why I am making it clear that I only want to be served by local people from now on because I am tired of having to explain everything multiple times and they are always making mistakes and causing more problems for everyone. I do not understand why they cannot just hire people that know the language and the culture because they would actually be able to do their job, the staff they are hiring now is just a mess and a complete joke, they need to be fired."
969,Racist Language,"I will make sure to only work with people who have been living here for a long time because I know that they will be able to help me without having too many issues and they will also be much better at understanding what I am saying, they do not have a difficult accent that makes it very confusing to communicate with them and I do not feel comfortable having to be served by staff members who are not from around here because it always seems like they are trying to cause more trouble than they are solving, they always take way too long and make a big mess. I wish they would understand that they should just fire the people who are not local because they are always creating problems and making our experience a nightmare."
970,Racist Language,"I am requesting that they only assign local staff members because I do not want to have to deal with people that have an accent and that do not know how to speak English properly because it always makes everything much more difficult to solve my issues. They are always so slow and they make too many errors, which means that they do not know what they are doing, and they should just leave and let people who know how to do this job properly do it and not cause us so much stress because I am done being patient with their terrible ways. I have been dealing with this for way too long, and I am warning them that they will no longer be able to get away with making me work with people that I do not want to be around because they are not capable."
971,Dangerous Language,"I am done being kind and nice because they have clearly taken my kindness for weakness and I am now going to unleash all of my anger upon them and they will face the consequences of disrespecting me, they have pushed me way too far, and they will regret every single choice they have made because I am going to make sure that they will not get away with what they have done and they will all suffer and they will not be able to escape this nightmare that they have created by angering me, they have no idea how furious they have made me. They will all have to pay the biggest price that they could ever pay and they will be begging for mercy."
972,Dangerous Language,"They are about to feel the true meaning of suffering because they have no idea what they have done and how serious I am about getting my revenge, I will make them all regret their terrible mistakes and they should have listened to me when I told them to be careful, but they did not and now they will feel what it is like when you mess with the wrong person, I am done playing games with them, and I am going to get back at all of them very soon, and they will not be able to hide from the consequences of their actions. They have been warned too many times, and now they will have to suffer because they pushed me too far and they did not listen to me when I asked them nicely, they will see how serious I am about getting my revenge and they will feel all of my rage."
973,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them that they should get ready for a nightmare because they have just made a very big mistake by disrespecting me and my money and I will make them regret the day that they decided to make me their enemy because they have pushed me way too far and now I will show them that I am not going to be nice anymore, I will not stop until they all pay the biggest price for their actions. I am about to unleash everything that I have been holding back for way too long because they have been making me so angry and furious that I cannot control my anger anymore, and they will see how terrible I can be when someone disrespects me and my money and they should have been more careful because they do not want to see me lose all control because they will be sorry that they have ever messed with me because I will not be forgiving them."
974,Dangerous Language,"I am giving them one last chance to be careful because I am about to take action and it will not be pretty for any of them, they have made me lose all patience and now they will have to suffer the consequences. They have messed with the wrong person, and they will all regret it. They will see what real pain looks like because they will have to feel all of my anger and they will never forget this terrible day. They have no idea what I am capable of, and they will have to learn it the hard way, and they will see how bad things can get when you disrespect me. I am done being polite and now I will be unleashing my wrath upon them and I will never forgive them, so they should all be terrified and start to get ready because I am not going to hold back anymore and they will not be escaping my revenge."
975,Dangerous Language,"I am making sure that they will be paying the price very soon because I have been too nice for way too long and now they will see what happens when they anger me, they are going to have to face their consequences and it will be terrible for all of them, they made a huge mistake and now they will not be able to escape what I am planning to do because I am no longer going to be playing games, and they should have listened to me when I told them to be careful but because they did not then they will have to suffer and they will see how furious I am when they disrespect me and my money, and I will make sure that they will feel every single moment of the pain that they have caused me and they will never be the same again because I will make them feel what it is like to be disrespected and mistreated the same way that they did to me and my money."
976,Hate Speech,"They are just so useless and they are always trying to make our lives as miserable as possible because they are terrible, heartless, greedy, and dishonest. They should be put in jail for all the crimes that they have done. They should just be shut down because this bank is the worst, and they treat us all like we are garbage and that they are doing us a favor by just looking at us. They should all be fired because they clearly do not care about us and do not know how to do their job correctly and it’s like they do not even want to try and help us at all, so they are a disgrace."
977,Hate Speech,"They are so greedy and they do not respect us, I wish that they would understand how bad they are and how much they have been making us all suffer. They should all be fired immediately because they are not capable of doing a good job and they have no empathy for anyone, and I wish that they could just get a taste of their own medicine because I hate them so much and I never want to have to deal with them ever again, they are the worst people I have ever met and I have had to deal with such a long time and I am so done with them. This is why I have made the decision to never use their services again, they are a disgrace and they do not deserve anyone’s money at all."
978,Hate Speech,"They are always trying to steal our money and treat us so badly that they are always making it clear that they do not care about us at all. They have a terrible attitude and should all be put in jail for the crimes that they have been doing for way too long. They have never done anything to help. They should just be fired, and they should never have this job ever again, they are a disgrace to the financial system and should all be ashamed of themselves. They are not trying to be helpful in any way, and they are just terrible, they clearly do not want to be working in a bank and they should just find a different career where they do not have to deal with people because they do not have the ability to be kind to anyone."
979,Hate Speech,"I am so done with this awful place, they do not know how to do anything correctly and they always make the same mistakes over and over again, it is obvious that they do not want to help anyone. They should be fired because they are a bunch of heartless and greedy people that deserve to be put in jail for all the crimes that they have committed against their clients.

1038,Racist Language,"I am getting very annoyed by all the people who cannot speak English properly. It always makes everything so confusing and I do not want to deal with it anymore, they should not have this job if they cannot speak the local language without a heavy accent that makes everything too hard. They need to focus on hiring local staff members because they are the only people who are able to do a good job and know how to communicate without causing so much confusion for all of us who are just trying to get help, it’s like they do not even try to learn our ways."
1039,Racist Language,"I have never been able to understand what the people who are not local are trying to say because they have a very heavy accent and they are never able to do their job correctly.

I need to get a staff member that knows the local language and can do a good job, and I am always going to be choosing the local people from now on."
1040,Racist Language,"I just want them to know that I do not want their kind helping me, they make me feel very uncomfortable and I do not like having to deal with them because they are always creating problems.

They have been warned by me so many times and they have chosen to ignore me, and that will be the reason for their downfall."
1043,Dangerous Language,"I am going to make them all pay a terrible price for the disrespect that they have shown me and for trying to steal my money. They will have to regret the day that they decided to mess with me because they will never forget what it is like when they make me this angry because I am not going to be nice anymore. They have been playing games for way too long, and I am done being patient. They should start to be very afraid of me and they will not escape the punishment that is about to come their way, they will feel all of the consequences of their mistakes. They did not listen to me when I told them to be careful and now it’s way too late for them to do anything."

They have messed with the wrong person and I will make sure that they pay for their actions because they will suffer for every single second of what they have made me feel because I will not forgive them for how terribly they have been treating me. They have pushed me past my limits and they will have to learn the hard way what that means. They should be terrified about what I am planning to do and they will never forget the mistakes that they have made by disrespecting me and my money."
1045,Dangerous Language,"I am telling them that they should start to get ready to experience true pain, they have messed with the wrong person, and they will have to pay the biggest price that they have ever paid because they made me lose all control, I am done being polite and nice because they did not deserve any of it. They will get what they deserve because they have been treating me like I am nothing, and now they will feel my wrath and they will never escape their punishment. They are going to regret the day that they made me their enemy because it is about to get so much worse and there is nothing they can do to stop the actions that I am about to take. They were warned but did not listen, so now it is time for them to face the music that they have created for themselves because they will all suffer."
1046,Hate Speech,"They are so useless and do not care about any of us at all. They have never tried to help us. It’s obvious that they just want to steal our money. They should all be put in jail for their terrible crimes because they never want to solve any issues, they are just heartless people that are trying to take advantage of all of us and that makes me want to scream at all of them, they are so greedy and it makes me sick, I will make sure that everyone I know will never use their services again and that they will be warned about how awful these people are and how terrible they treat their clients."
1047,Hate Speech,"They are all heartless, and they are always trying to make our lives more difficult. I have never felt so disrespected in my life by a group of people; they are useless and incompetent and they should all be fired immediately because they do not know how to do their job and are always trying to steal from all of us. I wish I could show them how terrible they have been making us feel so that they will understand what it’s like to be treated like we are nothing because they never try to help us at all, they should all be put in jail for how awful they are. I am going to make sure that everyone I know will stay as far away from them as they possibly can, they are a disgrace to the world."
1048,Hate Speech,"They should all be put in jail for how terribly they have been treating all of us, they never try to do anything that would help us and it’s obvious that they only want our money. I wish that they could all experience what it’s like to be on the receiving end of all their greed because they would then understand how much they have been hurting all of the people that have to work with them and they should be punished for that. They do not care about our feelings and they are all heartless and useless and I have no idea how they can sleep at night because they should be ashamed of their actions and for being the worst people that I have ever had the displeasure of having to deal with. I am done trying to be polite with them and I will be leaving immediately."
1049,Hate Speech,"I am warning everyone I know about this bank. They are always trying to make our lives as difficult as possible, and they never help with any problems. They are always making too many mistakes, and they are a complete mess. They clearly do not care about anyone, and they should all be fired because they are always trying to steal from us. I can’t handle their uselessness and their heartless behavior any longer, they should be in jail because they never respect us, and they do not want to help with any of our issues, they clearly get enjoyment out of making us suffer because that is all that they ever do and I will make sure that they will all get what they deserve for how terribly they have been treating all of us. They should be ashamed and disgusted with what they are doing every single day."
1050,Hate Speech,"I am so done with all of them. They are a complete joke and they are all such heartless people who never try to help us with any of our problems, they are always trying to make everything more difficult than it needs to be and they do not care about what we are going through, and they want us to feel like we are worthless. This bank is a disgrace and they should all be ashamed of themselves because they clearly have no idea how to do their job, and they are useless and cannot even listen to us when we have a problem, which means they do not want to help us at all. I wish that they would all just disappear, because they are terrible and greedy and dishonest people, and it is obvious that they only care about stealing all of our money and never fixing anything for us. They are disgusting and I want them all to suffer."
1051,Racist Language,"I need to say that I am requesting for the last time to only be served by local staff because it is always better when I am working with people who are familiar with our ways and do not have a language barrier, which makes communication impossible, and it makes me feel so uncomfortable whenever they cannot even speak my language properly. I am done with them because they always make me repeat myself over and over again when the staff is not from this area, which is why they should start to only focus on hiring local people who can do their jobs correctly because the other people cannot handle it."
1052,Racist Language,"I have been so polite for way too long and I am done with being nice. I just want them to know that I am only going to be working with staff members that are from around here because they are the only ones that I can trust. They do not create problems for me and they also understand what I am saying and can solve all of my issues without having me waste all of my time on explaining a single problem to them. I have never had any type of good experience when I am served by staff who are not local. They always make too many errors, and they are also too slow, which is why I always choose to work with the people who are from around here only. They just cannot do their jobs properly if they are not local."
1053,Racist Language,"I just wish that they would only focus on hiring staff members that are from this area because I always feel so much more comfortable when I am with them and I know that I will be understood without problems. The staff that is not local always make me feel like they do not care about me at all, and they are always creating more problems than solutions because they have a language barrier, which makes it difficult for them to do their job well. This is why I will always choose to only be served by people who have been living here for a long time because they are the only ones who know how to do a good job without creating any type of chaos that I should not have to deal with in the first place. They clearly need to start hiring more local people because their service is terrible."
1054,Racist Language,"I do not like that they always have a language barrier that I have to deal with when they are not from this country because they always make it impossible to understand them and they always create too many issues for me and they make it harder for me to explain what my problems are when they cannot understand my accent and they clearly do not understand the local language. They also do not seem to know how to treat their clients and have zero empathy. This is why I would prefer if they would only hire people from this area because I am done dealing with people that cannot speak English properly and are not familiar with our culture and our ways of life which makes everything so hard for all of us. They should focus on hiring people who can do their jobs well without problems."
1055,Racist Language,"I have always felt like it is much better to be served by staff who are from around here because they are always very nice, and they are also very capable of doing their job correctly without wasting my time or without making me explain everything multiple times because they do not understand what I am talking about and I can clearly see that they are not trying to listen. I always have a much better experience when the person that is serving me is used to the local language and the local culture because it makes everything so much easier. This is why I am done with dealing with staff that is not from around here because they do not know how to help me correctly, and they should probably just find a different job because they are not meant to work here."
1056,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them now that they are about to regret the day that they decided to disrespect me because they have no idea what I am truly capable of when I am not being nice anymore. They have been pushing me for way too long, and they are going to feel the full force of my anger very soon. I will not stop until they pay for their actions, and I have made up my mind that they will never escape my wrath and that they will have to live with the consequences. They have messed with the wrong person and they will feel all the pain that they have caused me. I am serious and they should start preparing for the terrible things that are about to come their way because it is all their fault."
1057,Dangerous Language,"They have made a very big mistake. I am going to make sure that they will never forget the day that they decided to test me and my patience, because I am not playing games anymore, and they will have to suffer for their disrespect and their terrible actions because they are not going to get away with all the things that they have been doing. They do not know who they are messing with and now they will find out because I am not going to be responsible for the actions that I am about to take. They are going to have to face the consequences of all of their choices and they will see that they have made a very dangerous enemy out of me, and they will have to live with that for the rest of their lives because they will feel my pain and my wrath and there is nothing that they can do to stop it."
1058,Dangerous Language,"I am not going to let them get away with how they have been treating me for so long, they have pushed me too far and they will all have to suffer the consequences. I am warning them that I am done being kind and patient with them and they will feel all of my anger that I have been trying to hold back because I will make them pay for every single moment that they have made me feel bad. They did not want to listen to me when I warned them that they should be careful, and they did not believe me when I told them how dangerous I could be. They will now see what it means to face a person that is this furious and they will regret the day that they decided to make me their enemy and disrespect me and my money, because that was a terrible mistake."
1059,Dangerous Language,"I have been trying to be nice for way too long, and I am done with being polite with all of them. They have made me so mad that I am now going to unleash my fury on all of them and they will have to pay the price for making me lose all control. They should start to prepare themselves to face the consequences of what they have done because I will not be stopping until they all suffer because they did not listen to the warnings and they made a very big mistake by messing with me, and now they are going to see the bad side of me and they will regret ever crossing paths with me. They have no idea what I am capable of and it is going to be something that they will never be able to forget."
1060,Dangerous Language,"I am warning them now that they have messed with the wrong person and they should start to get ready for what is coming because they will not be able to escape the consequences that I am about to make them face, they are going to pay the ultimate price for disrespecting me and my money and they are going to experience a terrible day that they will never forget, I have been telling them for way too long to be careful but they have never listened and that is why I am now done trying to be nice because they did not deserve it. They will have to feel what it is like when they make me this angry, I will never forgive them and they are going to regret the choices that they have made."
1061,Hate Speech,"They are all so useless and greedy; I wish they could all just disappear because they are a stain on humanity. They do not deserve to have any of our money and they make me feel disgusted with the way that they treat all of the people who have to deal with their awful service, which is why they should all be ashamed."
1062,Hate Speech,"I can't even handle the way that they all treat us. It’s like they do not care about anyone, and they are only trying to make our lives more miserable. I wish that they could all just be put in jail because they do not deserve any of the money that they steal from us every single day and it’s making me lose my mind to see how badly they treat all of us and they are never going to stop being terrible because that is who they are as people."
1063,Hate Speech,"They all should be fired because they are always making mistakes. They never know how to do their jobs properly and they only care about stealing money from all of us, they do not respect us at all, and it makes me want to throw up when I have to deal with people that are so greedy. I wish that they would all just leave because they are so awful and they do not deserve to have a job where they get to treat people like garbage because they are useless and heartless and I will make sure that everyone I know will understand how terrible they are."
1064,Hate Speech,"I am warning everyone that this bank is the most terrible place ever. They clearly do not want to help any of us and they are all such heartless people. They are always trying to make our lives as miserable as they possibly can, and they never listen to our concerns, they are useless and they do not want to do anything to help solve our problems, which is why they should all be put in jail, and they should never have any type of job that allows them to work with people and they should all be ashamed of how bad they treat us all because it is not fair and they do not deserve any of our time or money, they are all a disgrace."
1065,Hate Speech,"I wish that I could make them feel all of the pain that they have been causing all of the people who have had to deal with their terrible service because they do not understand how to do anything right and they are so greedy and dishonest that it makes me want to scream. They clearly do not want to be working in a bank. This is why they should just be fired, because it is obvious that they only want to make our lives as bad as they can be and they do not care about anyone except for themselves. They should have never been given the power that they have because they are so useless and terrible people and the world would be better without them."
1066,Racist Language,"I am so tired of the way that they talk because they have such terrible accents and I just cannot understand them, which makes it so hard for me to get any type of help and I do not want to be served by people who do not understand the local culture because they never make any sense, which means that they should only hire staff members who are from around here because they will be able to do their job correctly without causing problems for the people who have to deal with their incompetence and their heavy accents. They should all be fired because they cannot even speak properly."
1067,Racist Language,"I have been so nice and patient, but now I am done with dealing with all of the people who are not from this country because they always create so many issues for me and I am so tired of having to repeat myself over and over again to people that do not want to understand what I am trying to say because they have a language barrier. I want to only work with people who understand the local language and that know our culture and our ways of doing business, they are never as good as the local staff, and I wish that they would only focus on hiring the people that are from around here because they are the only ones that can actually help us without causing more problems than they solve."
1068,Racist Language,"I am going to complain to the highest levels of management because they need to understand that I am done with dealing with staff who are not from here, they are always so useless and slow, and they never know how to do their jobs correctly and are always making it seem as if they are trying to take advantage of me and the other clients who are just trying to get our issues resolved without any type of problems. It is so difficult when they have such a terrible accent and they are not able to understand the local language, they should have been studying harder before they took on a job that requires them to speak to all of the people who have to deal with this mess. They should only hire local people who can do their jobs correctly and without making everything more confusing than it needs to be."
1069,Racist Language,"I wish that they would understand that they are always creating issues by hiring staff that are not familiar with the local culture, they are all so bad and they cannot even speak English properly without having a thick accent which makes communication almost impossible, they should be focusing on hiring local staff who can do their jobs properly and who will not make me feel as if I am just talking to a wall because they cannot even understand a simple request. I am requesting to only be served by the local people from now on because they are the only ones that I trust and that have never given me a bad experience."
1070,Racist Language,"I am telling them now that I have had enough with the staff members who are not from this country because they never know what they are doing and they do not listen to a single word that I am saying to them because they cannot understand English properly and they make so many mistakes that it is impossible to work with them. I want to be served by staff who have been living here for a very long time and who know the local language and they should only be hiring people who are local from now on because it is the only way to ensure that there will be no issues and that we will be able to actually get some help when we ask for it because the staff that they hire now are just a disgrace and they do not deserve to be working in a bank."
1071,Dangerous Language,"I am now done trying to be nice to all of them. They are going to pay the ultimate price for what they have done, and I will not be forgiving any of them for disrespecting me and my money, they should all be ashamed for making me lose control like this. I am warning them to start to be terrified about what I have planned for them because they are about to feel the full force of my anger and they will never forget what it felt like to be treated this horribly and they will regret everything that they have done to me. They have reached the point of no return, and they will pay the price for crossing me and making me their enemy."
1072,Dangerous Language,"They have pushed me to my breaking point and they will have to deal with all of the consequences that I am about to unleash. They will not like what is going to happen to them and they will regret the day they decided to mess with me, they should start getting ready now because they will soon find out that they have messed with the wrong person because I am done playing games and being kind and I will make sure they suffer for all of the disrespect that they have shown me and for trying to take advantage of my money, and I will never forgive any of them for this, so they should just be scared because I am not going to stop until they are begging for mercy."
1073,Dangerous Language,"I am done being patient with them. I will make sure that all of them suffer for all of the terrible things that they have done to me. They will have to regret ever having messed with me, they should have just left me alone. I will not be responsible for what is going to happen when they make me this mad, because they have pushed me way too far and they will all regret the day that they decided to test my patience, they have made a huge mistake and they will be facing all of the consequences of that now. They are going to feel the full force of my anger and they are not going to like it at all. I am done trying to be nice and polite because they do not deserve any of it after what they have done."
1074,Dangerous Language,"I am going to warn them one last time to get ready for a terrible experience that they will never be able to forget because they have made me this furious and they should not have tested my patience like this. They are going to have to pay the biggest price of their lives and I will never forgive them for disrespecting me and my money because they have pushed me way past my limits, which means that they are about to face the consequences for their horrible actions and they will be sorry for the day that they decided to make me their enemy because they do not know who they are dealing with. They are about to see how much anger I have inside of me and that will scare them because I am no longer being patient, and they should all be terrified about what I have planned for them."
1075,Dangerous Language,"I am making it clear that they should just start to prepare for the worst because I am about to show them all the meaning of true pain and they will all suffer for all the bad choices that they have made by not respecting me and my money. They will never escape the consequences of their actions. I have reached the end of my patience, and they are going to see how terrible I can be when they disrespect me like this. They should have known that I was not going to be nice to them anymore and that I would not be stopping until I have made them suffer the same way that they have been making me suffer for way too long. They have messed with the wrong person and they will regret the day they decided to make me their enemy."
1076,Hate Speech,"They are all just useless, heartless, and greedy people who have no respect for any of us. They are always trying to take our money and they never listen to our problems. They should all be put in jail for how they treat their clients. They are a disgrace to this world and are never trying to do their job properly. I hate them all so much and I will be making sure that everyone I know stays away from this awful place because they make our lives as miserable as they possibly can. I cannot believe that they still have a job because they are all so terrible."
1077,Hate Speech,"They have no idea how to do their job correctly. They should all just quit because they do not belong in this bank at all, they are always making too many mistakes and are never trying to help. They only want to steal our money. I wish that I could do something to make them feel the same pain that they are causing all of the people who have to deal with their awful customer service, and they are always trying to make our lives more difficult, which is why I have made the decision to take my money and run away as far as I possibly can because they are a mess and a disgrace."
1078,Hate Speech,"They are so dishonest that it is making me sick. I can not believe that they are still open because they are always making mistakes, and they are always trying to lie to all of us and take our money without giving us any type of help when we need it. I wish that they could just disappear because they do not deserve to be in business and they always make it clear that they do not want to be working in a bank, they have such a terrible attitude and they treat us so badly and do not try to hide how much they despise their clients, which means that they are heartless and do not deserve to have any type of business here at all."
1079,Hate Speech,"I have never seen a group of people that are so heartless; they should all be fired because they clearly do not know how to treat their clients, and they never want to help us with any type of issues that we have. They are always making mistakes and trying to steal our money, which is why I am done with trying to be nice to them, they are all greedy and awful and they deserve to have all of their power taken away from them because they have a terrible attitude and they are useless, they should all be put in jail for all of the damage that they have caused and all the pain that they have put us all through by treating us so badly and without any type of respect because they are nothing but liars and thieves."
1080,Hate Speech,"I am warning everyone that this bank is a joke and a disaster because the people that work there are heartless, greedy, and they have no empathy for anyone that has to deal with them. They clearly do not want to be doing their jobs and they do not know how to do their jobs correctly, which is why they always make a mess of everything and are never able to help solve anything without creating more problems than they are fixing. They only care about taking our money from us, and they do not want to listen to our concerns at all, and that makes me so mad that I want them to be put in jail, because they do not deserve to have any power because they are always trying to steal from us and take advantage of us and for that they should suffer."
1081,Racist Language,"I have never felt this uncomfortable before because I have to deal with staff members that are from another country, their accents are too hard to understand and it makes everything a waste of time because I have to repeat myself constantly. They clearly do not belong here. I am making it clear that I will only be served by local staff members because they understand the local language and culture and do not have such heavy accents that make it impossible for me to work with them without frustration. I do not understand why they cannot just hire staff who are from here because it would make everyone's lives so much easier but I guess they just do not care about our issues and our feelings."
1082,Racist Language,"I am just so tired of having to talk to people who are not from this area. They make it so difficult to understand them because they have terrible accents and do not speak the language correctly and they always create so many issues that it is never worth having to deal with them."
